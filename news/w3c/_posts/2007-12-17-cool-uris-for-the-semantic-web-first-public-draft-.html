The Semantic Web Education and Outreach Interest Group has released a first Working Draft of a document explaining the effective use of URIs to enable the growth of the Semantic Web. URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) more simply called "Web addresses" are at the heart of the Web and also of the Semantic Web. <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-cooluris-20071217/">Cool URIs for the Semantic Web</a> discusses two strategies for choosing URIs for the Semantic Web, gives pointers to several Web sites that use these solutions, and briefly discusses why several other alternatives are less effective. Comments on this draft are requested by 21 January, to be integrated into a final document at the end of the Group's charter.
