</a> support that even constrained mobile devices can provide. This effort is part of W3C's ongoing efforts to make the Web easier to use from a mobile devices (see <a href="http://www.w3.org/News/2008#item129">related news</a>). For the CSS Mobile Profile 2.0, W3C has worked closely together with <a href="http://www.openmobilealliance.org">OMA</a> to remove the differences between W3C's and OMA's previous CSS-mobile profiles. An "alpha" quality <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/">test suite</a> is available for the mobile profile. The Working Group will <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/Mobile/2.0/css-mobile-implementations.html">track implementations</a> during the Candidate Recommendation phase. Implementers are invited to send feedback before February 2009.
