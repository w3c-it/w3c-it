The <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/EXI/">Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) Working Group</a> has published three documents: First Public Working Drafts of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-exi-best-practices-20071219/">EXI Best Practices</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-exi-primer-20071219/">EXI Primer</a>, as well as a Working Draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-exi-20071219/">EXI Format 1.0</a>. EXI is a very compact representation for the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml-infoset-20040204/">Extensible Markup Language (XML) Information Set</a> that is intended to simultaneously optimize performance and the utilization of computational resources. Using a relatively simple algorithm, which is amenable to fast and compact implementation, and a small set of data types, it reliably produces efficient encodings of XML event streams. The primer and best practices documents complement the format specification. The best practices document also presents information suitable for the general reader interested in EXI's intended role in the expanding Web.
