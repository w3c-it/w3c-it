The HTML Working Group released a Working Draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-xml-events-20070216/" shape="rect">XML Events 2: An Events Syntax for XML</a>. To associate behaviors with markup, language designers can incorporate the module in this specification to integrate event listeners and handlers with <acronym title="Document Object Model">DOM</acronym> Level 2 event interfaces. Version 2.0 adds new functionality for conditional handling of events, and adds explicit elements for handlers. It also has an updated XML schema and DTD and incorporates all known errors in the XML Events Recommendation of 2003.
