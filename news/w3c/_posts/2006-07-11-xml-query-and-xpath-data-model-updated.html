The XML Query and XSL Working Groups have released an updated Candidate Recommendation of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/CR-xpath-datamodel- 20060711/">XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Data Model (XDM)</a>. Both XSLT 2 and XQuery use XPath expressions and operate on XDM instances such as documents and databases. The group also released an updated Working Draft of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-xqupdate-20060711/">XQuery Update Facility</a> which provides expressions to create, modify and delete nodes.
