W3C updated its XHTML Modularization standard today with support for designing modular languages using <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xmlschema-1-20041028/">XML Schema</a>. The addition of schemas to <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xhtml-modularization-20081008/">XHTML Modularization 1.1</a> is an important step towards the <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/">XHTML2 Working Group</a>'s goal that XHTML support rich Web content and be extensible, while remaining interoperable. A modularization standard allows language designers to reuse elements defined by multiple parties (including other W3C standards such as SVG and MathML) and combine them into new formats to meet specific application needs. The standard allows people to use schema-enabled, off-the-shelf tools to immediately begin authoring and validating documents written in those new languages. The XHTML2 Working Group, which gained experience using Modularization 1.1 to build some <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/2008/xhtml-m12n-11-implementation.html">modules and languages</a>, now plans to add schema support to other XHTML standards.
