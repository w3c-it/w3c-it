The Web Application Formats Working Group has released the First Public Working Draft of <a href=" http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-WAPF-REQ-20060821/">Web Applications Packaging Format Requirements</a>. The document specifies design goals and requirements for packaging small client-side Web applications known as "widgets", "gadgets" or "modules," used to display and update remote data. Applications such as clocks, stock tickers, news casters, games and weather forecasters are packaged to allow a single download and installation on a client machine.
