The <a href="http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/">Web Applications Working Group</a> has published the Working Draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-WebIDL-20080829/">Web IDL</a>. This specification defines a syntactic subset of OMG IDL version 3.0 for use by specifications that define interfaces. Web IDL is an IDL variant with a number of features that allow the behavior of common script objects in the web platform to be specified more readily. A number of extensions are given to the IDL to support common functionality that previously must have been written in prose. In addition, precise language bindings for ECMAScript 3rd Edition and Java are given.
