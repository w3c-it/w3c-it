The <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/MWI/BPWG/">Mobile Web Best Practices Working Group</a> and the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/"><acronym title="Web Accessibility Initiative">WAI</acronym> Education and Outreach Working Group</a> have published the First Public Working Draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/mwbp-wcag/">Relationship Between Mobile Web Best Practices 1.0 and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a>. See the <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2008JanMar/0014.html">announcement email</a>. <p>The groups encourage people to start by reading <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/mobile/">Web Content Accessibility and Mobile Web: Making a Web Site Accessible Both for People with Disabilities and for Mobile Devices</a>, which shows how design goals for accessibility and mobile access overlap. A third document, <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/mobile/experiences">Experiences Shared by People with Disabilities and by People Using Mobile Devices</a>, provides examples of barriers that people (without disabilities) face when interacting with Web content via mobile devices, and similar barriers for people with disabilities using desktop computers.
