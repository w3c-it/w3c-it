Two licenses promote two goals: <ol> <li>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2008/03-bsd-license.html">3-clause BSD License</a> is designed to enable developers to use test cases easily, and promote software development and bugtracking.</li> <li>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2008/04-testsuite-license.html">W3C Test Suite License</a> is designed to enable a W3C Working Group to create a branded, "Authoritative W3C Test Suite" to reflect the group consensus process, and to promote interoperability and stability of performance claims.</li> </ol> <p>W3C appreciates the support of those who suggested these changes, who provided use cases, and who patiently reviewed drafts.<span class="archive"> (Archivio News <a title="The Power of Tests: New Licenses Promote Collaboration" href="http://www.w3.org/News/2008#item145" rel="details">Inglese</a>, <a title="The Power of Tests: New Licenses Promote Collaboration" href="http://www.w3c.it/News#x20080820" rel="details">Italiano</a>) </span>
