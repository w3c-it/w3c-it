The XForms Working Group released a Last Call Working Draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-xforms11-20070222/">XForms 1.1</a>, a foundation for the next generation of forms for the Web. Comments are welcome through 5 April. XForms 1.1 adds to version 1.0: several new submission capabilities, action handlers, utility functions, user interface improvements, and helpful datatypes as well as a more powerful action processing facility, including conditional, iterated and background execution, the ability to manipulate data arbitrarily and access to event context information.
