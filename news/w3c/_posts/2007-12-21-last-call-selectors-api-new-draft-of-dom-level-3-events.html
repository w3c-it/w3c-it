The <a href="http://www.w3.org/2006/webapi/">Web API Working Group</a> has published the Last Call Working Draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-selectors-api-20071221/">Selectors API</a>. Selectors, which are widely used in <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">CSS</a>, are patterns that match against elements in a tree structure. The Selectors API specification defines methods for retrieving Element nodes from the Document Object Model (<abbr>DOM</abbr>) by matching against a group of selectors. Comments are welcome through 06 January 2008. The Working Group has also published a Working Draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-20071221/">DOM Level 3 Events</a>, a generic platform- and language-neutral event system which allows registration of event handlers, describes event flow through a tree structure, and provides basic contextual information for each event.
