The <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/EXI/">Efficient XML Interchange Working Group</a> published two Working Drafts today: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-exi-20080728/">Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) Format 1.0</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-exi-evaluation-20080728/">Efficient XML Interchange Evaluation</a>. The former specifies the Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) format. EXI is a very compact representation for the Extensible Markup Language (XML) Information Set that is intended to simultaneously optimize performance and the utilization of computational resources. The EXI format uses a hybrid approach drawn from the information and formal language theories, plus practical techniques verified by measurements, for entropy encoding XML information. Using a relatively simple algorithm, which is amenable to fast and compact implementation, and a small set of data types, it reliably produces efficient encodings of XML event streams. The latter document, a first public draft, is an evaluation of the Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) Format 1.0 with reference to the Properties identified by the (now closed) XML Binary Characterization (XBC) Working Group, relative to XML, gzipped XML and ASN.1 PER.
