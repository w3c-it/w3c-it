The <a href="http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/">SYMM Working Group</a> has published the Last Call Working Draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-timesheets-20080110/">SMIL Timesheets 1.0</a>; this is also the First Public Working Draft. This document defines an XML timing language that makes SMIL 3.0 element and attribute timing control available to a wide range of other XML languages. This language allows SMIL timing to be integrated into a wide variety of a-temporal languages, even when several such languages are combined in a compound document. Because of its similarity with external style and positioning descriptions in the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) language, this functionality has been termed SMIL Timesheets. Comments are welcome through 15 February.
