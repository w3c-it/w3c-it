W3C today published an early draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-html5-20080122/">HTML 5</a>, a major revision of the markup language for the Web. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/">HTML Working Group</a> is creating HTML 5 to be the open, royalty-free specification for rich Web content and Web applications. "HTML is of course a very important standard," said Tim Berners-Lee, author of the first version of HTML and W3C Director. "I am glad to see that the community of developers, including browser vendors, is working together to create the best possible path for the Web." New features include APIs for drawing two-dimensional graphics and ways to embed and control audio and video content. HTML 5 helps to improve interoperability and reduce software costs by giving precise rules not only about how to handle all correct HTML documents but also how to recover from errors.
