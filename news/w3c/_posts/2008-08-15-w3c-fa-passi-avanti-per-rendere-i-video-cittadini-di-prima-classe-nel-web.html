</a> Web-based video is exploding, for advertising, enterprise collaboration, entertainment, product reviews, and other applications. As prices drop for consumer electronics, amateur and professionals alike are creating increasingly high quality videos. Social networks are sprouting up around Web-delivered media. W3C today launched a new <a href="http://www.w3.org/2008/WebVideo/">Video in the Web Activity</a> to make video a "first-class citizen" of the Web. The initial scope of work, determined as a result of a successful <a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/08/video/report.html">W3C Workshop on Video</a> will be conducted by three groups: <ul> <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/2008/WebVideo/Annotations/">Media Annotations</a>, which will provide an ontology designed to facilitate cross-community data integration of information related to media objects in the Web, such as video, audio and images.</li> <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/2008/WebVideo/Fragments/">Media Fragments</a>, which will address temporary and spatial links (i.e., into a particular moment of a multimedia track, or location in two visual dimensions) using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs).</li> <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/TT/">Timed Text</a>, which will work on a standard for online captioning.</li> </ul> <p>W3C continues to investigate the important topics of audio and video codecs on the Web.
