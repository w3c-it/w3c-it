The <a href="http://www.w3.org/2006/07/SWD/">Semantic Web Deployment Working Group </a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/">XHTML2 Working Group</a> have published the Proposed Recommendation of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/PR-rdfa-syntax-20080904/">RDFa in XHTML: Syntax and Processing</a>. The modern Web is made up of an enormous number of documents that have been created using HTML. These documents contain significant amounts of structured data, which is largely unavailable to tools and applications. When publishers can express this data more completely, and when tools can read it, a new world of user functionality becomes available, letting users transfer structured data between applications and web sites, and allowing browsing applications to improve the user experience. RDFa is a specification for attributes to express structured data in any markup language. The groups have also published an <a href="http://www.w3.org/2006/07/SWD/RDFa/implementation-report/">implementation report</a> as part of the Candidate Recommendation phase. Comments are welcome through 03 October.
