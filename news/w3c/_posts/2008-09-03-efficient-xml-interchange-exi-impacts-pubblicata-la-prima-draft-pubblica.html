The <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/EXI/">Efficient XML Interchange Working Group</a> has published the First Public Working Draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-exi-impacts-20080903/">Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) Impacts</a>. EXI defines a new representation for the Extensible Markup Language (XML) Information Set. The introduction of such a format may cause disruption in systems that have so far been able to assume XML as the only representation of XML Information Set data. This document reviews areas where the introduction of EXI may disrupt or otherwise have an impact on existing XML technologies, XML processors, and applications. It also describes EXI design features and steps that may be taken by implementors to reduce or eliminate disruption and impacts.
