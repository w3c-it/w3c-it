W3C's <a href="http://www.w3.org/DOM/">Document Object Model (DOM) Activity</a> is now closed. The Document Object Model Working Group closed in the early 2004 after the completion of the DOM Level 3 Recommendations. Since then, several W3C Working Groups have taken the lead in maintaining and continuing to develop standard APIs for the Web; these include the HTML, SVG, CSS, and WebAPI Working Groups. W3C will continue to develop APIs in various Working Groups.
