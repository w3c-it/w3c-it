The <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/MWI/DDWG/">Mobile Web Initiative Device Description Working Group</a> has published the Group Note of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/NOTE-DDR-requirements-20071217/">Device Description Repository Requirements 1.0</a>. This document describes the use cases for a Device Description Repository (DDR). Each use case is analyzed in order to determine the behavior expected of a DDR in order to realize it. These expected behaviors are captured as high-level requirements, which when normalized across all use cases, lead to a discrete set of DDR requirements.
