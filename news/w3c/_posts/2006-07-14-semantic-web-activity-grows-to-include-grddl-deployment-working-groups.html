W3C is pleased to announce the renewal of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">Semantic Web Activity</a>. "W3C continues to support the advancement of universal sharing and automatic processing of data in the World Wide Web," said Ivan Herman (W3C). Semantic Web technologies allow data to be shared and reused across applications, enterprises, and communities. The W3C Advisory Committee approved the continuing work in RDF data access, rules interchange, and health care and life sciences. Three new groups are chartered for work on Semantic Web deployment, extracting RDF from XML (e.g., to process microformats), and education and outreach. <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/join">Join W3C</a> and visit the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">Semantic Web home page</a>. <span class="archive">(Archivio News <a rel="details" title="Semantic Web Activity Grows to include GRDDL, Deployment Working Groups"></a><a href="http://www.w3.org/News/2006#item127">inglese</a>, <a href="http://www.w3c.it/News#x20060714a">italiano</a>)</span>
