The Voice Browser Working Group released updated Working Drafts of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-speech-synthesis11-20070611/">Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) Version 1.1</a> and its <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-ssml11reqs-20070611/">Requirements</a>. Version 1.1 improves on W3C's <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis/">SSML 1.0 Recommendation</a> by adding support for more conventions and practices of the world's languages including Asian, Eastern European, and Middle Eastern languages. Both documents follow discussions from the three W3C Workshops on extending SSML.
