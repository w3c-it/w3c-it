      The W3C standards and technologies represent a huge
      opportunity for all companies to develop their presence and
      business in the WWW. W3C provides a stable and powerful
      complete architecture for applications development and long
      term vision and also the right environment to develop new
      ideas, to influence the technology and to take a leadership
      role. This event is the perfect catalyst for all the
      Italian companies to integrate their creativity with the
      Web, as the Web is for everyone and it's also a way to
      develop a stronger collaboration between Italian companies
      and the W3C community.
