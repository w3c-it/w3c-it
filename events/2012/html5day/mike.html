      Bio
    </h2>
    <p>
      Michael[tm] Smith is the W3C's HTML Activity Lead. He
      joined the W3C in 2007 to work on W3C standards for
      browsing technologies; in particular, the phenomenon known
      as HTML5, as well as other standards related to APIs for
      Web applications. He's been based in Tokyo since 2001.
      Prior to joining the W3C, he worked for Opera Software, and
      prior to that, for Openwave Systems - most of that time
      involved with design, development, testing, and deployment
      of software for mobile operators in Japan.

      This presentation will provide an overview of key new
      browser technologies that are being added to the Web
      platform: features from the HTML5 spec, from CSS3 specs,
      and selected technologies from more than 40 other specs
      which are currently in development in various W3C working
      groups. The presentation will take a look at which browsers
      have implemented the features, with an eye on giving you an
      idea of which features you can use now -- which are "market
      ready" -- and which features are not there yet.
