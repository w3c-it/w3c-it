<h2 class="notoc"><a name="abstract" id="abstract">Abstract</a></h2>
<p>The mission of the World Wide Web Consortium (<acronym>W3C</acronym>) is to
lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing common protocols
that promote its evolution and ensure its interoperability. The W3C Process
Document describes the organizational structure of the W3C and the processes
related to the responsibilities and functions they exercise to enable W3C to
accomplish its mission. This document does not describe the internal workings
of the Team or W3C's public communication mechanisms.</p>
<p>For more information about the W3C mission and the history of W3C, please
refer to <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/">About W3C</a> [<a href="#ref-mission">PUB15</a>].</p>
<h2 class="notoc"><a name="status" id="status">Status of this Document</a></h2>
<p>This is the 14 October 2005 version of the W3C Process Document. This
document has been produced by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Member/Board/">W3C Advisory
Board</a> and reviewed by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List">W3C Members</a>
and Team.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/ProcessChanges">list of changes to the
public Process Document</a> is available on the Web.</p>
<p>W3C, including all existing chartered groups, follows the most recent
operative Process Document announced to the Membership.</p>
<p>Please send comments about this document to process-issues@w3.org (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/process-issues/">Member-only
archive</a>).</p>
<p>Additional Member-only information about the Process Document (e.g., issues
lists, Member-only drafts, and changes to Member-only drafts) is available from
the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/Plan/">Process Plan page</a>. General
information <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/">about W3C</a> is available on the Web,
including information about <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/join">becoming a W3C
Member</a>.</p>
<p>The terms MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, REQUIRED, and MAY when
highlighted (through style sheets, and in uppercase in the source) are used in
accordance with <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC 2119</a>
[<a href="#ref-RFC2119">RFC2119</a>]. The term NOT REQUIRED (not defined in RFC
2119) indicates exemption.</p>
<p>Some terms have been capitalized in this document (and in other W3C
materials) to indicate that they are entities with special relevance to the W3C
Process. These terms are defined herein, and readers should be aware that the
ordinary (English) definitions are incomplete for purposes of understanding
this document.</p>
<h2 class="notoc"><a name="pp" id="pp">Relation of Process Document to Patent
Policy</a></h2>
<p>W3C Members' attention is called to the fact that provisions of the Process
Document are binding on Members per the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Agreement/Member-Agreement">Membership
Agreement</a> [<a href="#ref-member-agreement">PUB6</a>]. The Patent Policy
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy">W3C Patent Policy</a>
[<a href="#ref-patentpolicy">PUB33</a>] is incorporated by normative reference
as a part of the Process Document, and is thus equally binding.</p>
<p>The Patent Policy places additional obligations on Members, Team, and other
participants in W3C. The Process Document does not restate those requirements
but includes references to them. The Process Document and Patent Policy have
been designed so that they may evolve independently.</p>
<p>In the Process Document, the term "participant" refers to an individual, not
an organization.</p>

<h2>1 <a name="Intro" id="Intro">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Most W3C work revolves around the standardization of Web technologies. To
accomplish this work, W3C follows processes that promote the development of
high-quality standards based on the <a href="#Consensus">consensus</a> of the
Membership, Team, and public. W3C processes promote fairness, responsiveness,
and progress: all facets of the W3C mission. This document describes the
processes W3C follows in pursuit of its mission.</p>
<p>Here is a general overview of how W3C standardizes a Web technology. In many
cases, the goal of this work is a <a href="#RecsW3C">W3C Recommendation</a>,
the W3C equivalent of a Web standard.</p>
<ol>
<li>People generate interest in a particular topic (e.g., Web services). For
instance, Members express interest in the form of <a href="#Submission">Member
Submissions</a>, and the <a href="#Team">Team</a> monitors work inside and
outside of W3C for signs of interest. Also, W3C is likely to organize a
<a href="#GAEvents">Workshop</a> to bring people together to discuss topics
that interest the W3C community. This was the case, for example, with Web
services.</li>
<li>When there is enough interest in a topic (e.g., after a successful Workshop
and/or discussion on an <a href="#ACCommunication">Advisory Committee mailing
list</a>), the Director announces the <a href="#ActivityDevelopment">development of a proposal for a new Activity</a> or
<a href="#WGCharterDevelopment">Working Group charter</a>, depending on the
breadth of the topic of interest. An <a href="#ActivityProposal">Activity
Proposal</a> describes the scope, duration, and other characteristics of the
intended work, and includes the charters of one or more <a href="#GAGeneral">Working Groups, Interest Groups, and possibly Coordination
Groups</a> to carry out the work. W3C Members <a href="#ActivityCreation">review each Activity Proposal</a> and the associated
Working Group charters. When there is support within W3C for investing
resources in the topic of interest, the Director approves the new Activity and
groups get down to work. For the Web Services Activity, the initial Activity
Proposal called for one Working Group to work on Web Services Architecture and
one to work on a language for Web Services Description. The Activity Proposal
also incorporated an existing Working Group (from another Activity) working on
XML Protocols.</li>
<li>There are three types of Working Group participants: <a href="#member-rep">Member representatives</a>, <a href="#invited-expert-wg">Invited
Experts</a>, and <a href="#Team">Team representatives</a>. Team representatives
both contribute to the technical work and help ensure the group's proper
integration with the rest of W3C. The <a href="#WGCharter">Working Group
charter</a> sets expectations about each group's deliverables (e.g., <a href="#Reports">technical reports</a>, test suites, and tutorials).</li>
<li>Working Groups generally create specifications and guidelines that undergo
cycles of revision and review as they <a href="#rec-advance">advance to W3C
Recommendation</a> status. The W3C process for producing these technical
reports includes significant review by the Members and public, and requirements
that the Working Group be able to show implementation and interoperability
experience. At the end of the process, the Advisory Committee reviews the
mature technical report, and if there is support, W3C publishes it as a
<a href="#RecsW3C">Recommendation</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Process Document promotes the goals of quality and fairness in technical
decisions by encouraging <a href="#Consensus">consensus</a>, requiring reviews
(by both Members and public) as part of the <a href="#Recs">technical report
development process</a>, and through an <a href="#ACAppeal">appeal process</a>
for the Advisory Committee.</p>
<p>The other sections of the Process Document:</p>
<ol>
<li>set forth <a href="#Policies">policies</a> for participation in W3C
groups,</li>
<li>establish two permanent groups within W3C: the <a href="#TAG">Technical
Architecture Group (TAG)</a>, to help resolve Consortium-wide technical issues;
and the <a href="#AB">Advisory Board (AB)</a>, to help resolve Consortium-wide
non-technical issues, and to manage the <a href="#GAProcess">evolution of the
W3C process</a>, and</li>
<li>describe other interactions between the <a href="#Members">Members</a> (as
represented by the <a href="#AC">W3C Advisory Committee</a>), the Team, and the
general public.</li>

<h2>2 <a name="Organization" id="Organization">Members, Advisory Committee,
Team, Advisory Board, Technical Architecture Group</a></h2>
<p>W3C's mission is to lead the Web to its full potential. W3C <a href="#Members">Member</a> organizations provide resources to this end, and the W3C
<a href="#Team">Team</a> provides the technical leadership and organization to
coordinate the effort.</p>
<h3>2.1 <a name="Members" id="Members">Members</a></h3>
<p>W3C Members are primarily represented in W3C processes as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <a href="#AC">Advisory Committee</a> is composed of one representative
from each Member organization (refer to the <a href="#Member-only">Member-only</a> list of <a href="http://www.w3.org/Member/ACList">current Advisory Committee
representatives</a> [<a href="#ref-current-ac">MEM1</a>]). The Advisory

<li>Representatives of Member organizations participate in <a href="#GAGeneral">Working Groups, Interest Groups, and Coordination Groups</a> and
author and review <a href="#Recs">technical reports</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p><a name="MemberSubscription" id="MemberSubscription">W3C membership</a> is
open to all entities, as described in "<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/join">How to Join W3C</a>" [<a href="#ref-join-w3c">PUB5</a>]; (refer to the public list of <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List">current W3C Members</a> [<a href="#ref-current-mem">PUB8</a>]). Organizations subscribe according to the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Agreement/Member-Agreement">Membership

participation agreements remain <a href="#Team-only">Team-only</a> and that no
Member receives preferential treatment within W3C.</p>
<p><a name="IndividualParticipation" id="IndividualParticipation">W3C does not
have a class of membership tailored to, or priced for individuals</a>. However,
an individual <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> join W3C as an Affiliate Member.
In this case the same restrictions pertaining to <a href="#MemberRelated">related Members</a> apply when the individual also <a href="#member-rep">represents</a> another W3C Member.</p>
<h4>2.1.1 <a name="MemberBenefits" id="MemberBenefits">Rights of
Members</a></h4>
<p>Each Member organization enjoys the following rights and benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>A seat on the <a href="#AC">Advisory Committee</a>;</li>
<li>Access to <a href="#Member-only">Member-only</a> information;</li>
<li>The <a href="#Submission">Member Submission</a> process;</li>
<li>Use of the W3C Member logo on promotional material and to publicize the
Member's participation in W3C. For more information, please refer to the Member
logo usage policy described in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Member/Intro">New
Member Orientation</a> [<a href="#ref-new-member">MEM4</a>].</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, representatives of Member organizations participate in W3C as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="#GAGeneral">Working Groups, Interest Groups, and Coordination
Groups</a>.</li>
<li>In <a href="#GAEvents">Workshops and Symposia</a>;</li>

</ul>
<p>In the case (described in paragraph 5g of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Agreement/Member-Agreement">Membership
Agreement</a>), where a Member organization is itself a consortium, user
society, or otherwise has members or sponsors, the organization's paid staff
and Advisory Committee representative exercise all the rights and privileges of
W3C membership. In addition, the Advisory Committee representative <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> designate up to four (or more at the Team's discretion)
individuals who, though not employed by the organization, <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> exercise the rights of <a href="#member-rep">Member
representatives</a>. These individuals <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
disclose their employment affiliation when participating in W3C work.
Provisions for <a href="#MemberRelated">related Members</a> apply. Furthermore,
these individuals are expected to represent the broad interests of the W3C
Member organization and not the parochial interests of their employers.</p>
<p>The rights and benefits of W3C membership are contingent upon conformance to
the processes described in this document. The vast majority of W3C Members
faithfully follow the spirit as well as the letter of these processes. When
serious and/or repeated violations do occur, and repeated attempts to address
these violations have not resolved the situation, the Director <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> take disciplinary action. Arbitration in the case of
further disagreement is governed by paragraph 19 of the Membership Agreement.
Refer to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/09/discipline">Guidelines for
Disciplinary Action</a> [<a href="#ref-discipline-gl">MEM14</a>].</p>
<h4>2.1.2 <a name="MemberRelated" id="MemberRelated">Related Members</a></h4>
<p>In the interest of ensuring the integrity of the consensus process, Member
involvement in some of the processes in this document is affected by related
Member status. As used herein, two Members are related if:</p>
<ol>
<li>Either Member is a subsidiary of the other, or</li>
<li>Both Members are subsidiaries of a common entity, or</li>
<li>The Members have an employment contract or consulting contract that affects
W3C participation.</li>
</ol>
<p>A <em>subsidiary</em> is an organization of which effective control and/or
majority ownership rests with another, single organization.</p>
<p>Related Members <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> disclose these
relationships according to the mechanisms described in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Member/Intro">New Member Orientation</a> [<a href="#ref-new-member">MEM4</a>].</p>
<h4>2.1.3 <a name="AC" id="AC">Advisory Committee (AC)</a></h4>
<p>When an organization joins W3C (see "<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/join">How to Join W3C</a>" [<a href="#ref-join-w3c">PUB5</a>]), it <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> name its
Advisory Committee representative as part of the Membership Agreement. The
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Member/Intro">New Member Orientation</a> explains
how to subscribe or unsubscribe to Advisory Committee mailing lists, provides
information about Advisory Committee meetings, explains how to name a new
Advisory Committee representative, and more. Advisory Committee representatives
<span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> follow the <a href="#coi">conflict of
interest policy</a> by disclosing information according to the mechanisms
described in the New Member Orientation. See also the additional roles of

<h5>2.1.3.1 <a name="ACCommunication" id="ACCommunication">Advisory Committee
Mailing Lists</a></h5>
<p>The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> provide two mailing lists for use
by the Advisory Committee:</p>
<ol>
<li>One for official announcements (e.g., those required by this document) from
the Team to the Advisory Committee. This list is read-only for Advisory
Committee representatives.</li>
<li>One for discussion among Advisory Committee representatives. Though this
list is primarily for Advisory Committee representatives, the Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> monitor discussion and <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> participate in discussion when appropriate. Ongoing
detailed discussions <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> be moved to other
appropriate lists (new or existing, such as a mailing list created for a
<a href="#GAEvents">Workshop</a>).</li>
</ol>
<p>An Advisory Committee representative <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
request that additional individuals from their organization be subscribed to
these lists. Failure to contain distribution internally <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> result in suspension of additional email addresses, at the
discretion of the Team.</p>
<h5>2.1.3.2 <a name="ACMeetings" id="ACMeetings">Advisory Committee
Meetings</a></h5>
<p>The Team organizes a <a href="#ftf-meeting">face-to-face meeting</a> for the
Advisory Committee <span class="time-interval">twice a year</span>. The Team
appoints the Chair of these meetings (generally the <a href="#def-W3CChair" rel="glossary" title="Definition of W3C Chair"><span class="dfn-instance">W3C
Chair</span></a> or <a href="#def-COO" rel="glossary" title="Definition of Chief Operating Officer"><span class="dfn-instance">Chief

</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Each Member organization <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> send one
<a href="#member-rep">representative</a> to each Advisory Committee meeting. In
exceptional circumstances (e.g., during a period of transition between
representatives from an organization), the meeting Chair <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> allow a Member organization to send two representatives to
a meeting.</p>
<p>The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> announce the date and location of
each Advisory Committee meeting no later than at the end of the previous
meeting; <span class="time-interval">one year's</span> notice is preferred. The
Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> announce the region of each Advisory
Committee meeting at least <span class="time-interval">one year</span> in
advance.</p>

<h3>2.2 <a name="Team" id="Team">The W3C Team</a></h3>
<p>The Team consists of the W3C paid staff, unpaid interns, and W3C Fellows.
<a name="fellows" id="fellows">W3C Fellows</a> are Member employees working as
part of the Team; see the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Recruitment/Fellows">W3C Fellows Program</a>
[<a href="#ref-fellows">PUB32</a>]. The Team provides technical leadership
about Web technologies, organizes and manages W3C Activities to reach goals
within practical constraints (such as resources available), and communicates
with the Members and the public about the Web and W3C technologies.</p>
<p>The Team is led by the Director, W3C Chair, and Chief Operating Officer.
These individuals <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> delegate responsibility
(generally to other individuals in the Team) for any of their roles described
in this document.</p>
<p>The <a name="def-Director" id="def-Director"><dfn><b>Director</b></dfn></a>

institutions</a>: the European Research Consortium for Informatics and
Mathematics (<acronym>ERCIM</acronym>), Keio University, and the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (<acronym>MIT</acronym>). Within W3C, the Host
institutions are governed by joint sponsorship contracts; the Hosts themselves
are not W3C Members.</p>
<h4>2.2.1 <a name="TeamSubmission" id="TeamSubmission">Team
Submissions</a></h4>
<p>Team members <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> request that the Director
publish information at the W3C Web site. At the Director's discretion, these
documents are published as "Team Submissions". These documents are analogous to
<a href="#Submission">Member Submissions</a> (e.g., in <a href="#SubmissionScope">expected scope</a>). However, there is no additional Team
comment. The <a href="#DocumentStatus">document status section</a> of a Team
Submission indicates the level of Team consensus about the published
material.</p>
<p>Team Submissions are <strong>not</strong> part of the <a href="#Reports">technical report development process</a>.</p>
<p>The list of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/">published Team
Submissions</a> [<a href="#ref-team-submission-list">PUB16</a>] is available at
the W3C Web site.</p>
<h3>2.3 <a name="AB" id="AB">Advisory Board (AB)</a></h3>
<p>Created in March 1998, the Advisory Board provides ongoing guidance to the
Team on issues of strategy, management, legal matters, process, and conflict
resolution. The Advisory Board also serves the Members by tracking issues
raised between Advisory Committee meetings, soliciting Member comments on such
issues, and proposing actions to resolve these issues. The Advisory Board
manages the <a href="#GAProcess">evolution of the Process Document</a>. The
Advisory Board hears appeals of <a href="#SubmissionNo">Member Submission
requests</a> that are rejected for reasons unrelated to Web architecture; see
also the <a href="#TAG">TAG</a>.</p>
<p>The Advisory Board is <strong>not</strong> a board of directors and has no
decision-making authority within W3C; its role is strictly advisory.</p>
<p>The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> make available a mailing list for
the Advisory Board to use for its communication, confidential to the Advisory
Board and Team.</p>
<p>The Advisory Board <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> send a summary of
each of its meetings to the Advisory Committee and other group Chairs. The
Advisory Board <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> also report on its
activities at each <a href="#ACMeetings">Advisory Committee meeting</a>.</p>
<p>Details about the Advisory Board (e.g., the list of Advisory Board
participants, mailing list information, and summaries of Advisory Board
meetings) are available at the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/ab/">Advisory
Board home page</a> [<a href="#ref-ab-home">PUB30</a>].</p>
<h4>2.3.1 <a name="ABParticipation" id="ABParticipation">Advisory Board
Participation</a></h4>
<p>The Advisory Board consists of nine elected participants and a Chair. The
Team appoints the Chair of the <a href="#AB">Advisory Board</a>, who is
generally the <a href="#def-W3CChair" rel="glossary" title="Definition of W3C Chair"><span class="dfn-instance">W3C Chair</span></a>.</p>
<p>The remaining nine Advisory Board participants are elected by the W3C
Advisory Committee following the <a href="#AB-TAG-elections">AB/TAG nomination
and election process</a>.</p>
<p>With the exception of the Chair, the terms of all Advisory Board
participants are for <span class="time-interval">two years</span>. Terms are
staggered so that each year, either four or five terms expire. If an individual
is elected to fill an incomplete term, that individual's term ends at the
normal expiration date of that term. Regular Advisory Board terms begin on 1
July and end on 30 June.</p>
<h3>2.4 <a name="TAG" id="TAG">Technical Architecture Group (TAG)</a></h3>
<p>Created in February 2001, the mission of the TAG is stewardship of the Web
architecture. There are three aspects to this mission:</p>
<ol>
<li>to document and build consensus around principles of Web architecture and
to interpret and clarify these principles when necessary;</li>
<li>to resolve issues involving general Web architecture brought to the
TAG;</li>
<li>to help coordinate cross-technology architecture developments inside and
outside W3C.</li>
</ol>
<p>The TAG hears appeals of <a href="#SubmissionNo">Member Submission
requests</a> that are rejected for reasons related to Web architecture; see
also the <a href="#AB">Advisory Board</a>.</p>
<p>The TAG's scope is limited to technical issues about Web architecture. The
TAG <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD NOT</span> consider administrative, process,
or organizational policy issues of W3C, which are generally addressed by the
W3C Advisory Committee, Advisory Board, and Team. Please refer to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/07/19-tag">TAG charter</a> [<a href="#ref-tag-charter">PUB25</a>] for more information about the background and
scope of the TAG, and the expected qualifications of TAG participants.</p>
<p>The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> make available two mailing lists
for the TAG:</p>
<ul>
<li>a public discussion (not just input) list for issues of Web architecture.
The TAG will conduct its public business on this list.</li>
<li>a <a href="#Member-only">Member-only</a> list for discussions within the
TAG and for requests to the TAG that, for whatever reason, cannot be made on
the public list.</li>
</ul>
<p>The TAG <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> also request the creation of
additional topic-specific, public mailing lists. For some TAG discussions
(e.g., an appeal of a <a href="#SubmissionNo">rejected Member Submission
request</a>), the TAG <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> use a list that will be
<a href="#Member-only">Member-only</a>.</p>
<p>The TAG <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> send a summary of each of its
<a href="#GeneralMeetings">meetings</a> to the Advisory Committee and other
group Chairs. The TAG <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> also report on its
activities at each <a href="#ACMeetings">Advisory Committee meeting</a>.</p>
<p>When the TAG votes to resolve an issue, each TAG participant (whether
appointed, elected, or the Chair) has one vote; see also the section on
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/07/19-tag#Voting">voting in the TAG charter</a>
[<a href="#ref-tag-charter">PUB25</a>] and the general section on <a href="#Votes">votes</a> in this Process Document.</p>
<p>Details about the TAG (e.g., the list of TAG participants, mailing list
information, and summaries of TAG meetings) are available at the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/">TAG home page</a> [<a href="#ref-tag-home">PUB26</a>].</p>
<h4>2.4.1 <a id="tag-participation" name="tag-participation">Technical
Architecture Group Participation</a></h4>
<p>The TAG consists of eight elected or appointed participants and a Chair. The
Team appoints the Chair of the TAG, who is generally the <a href="#def-Director" rel="glossary" title="Definition of Director"><span class="dfn-instance">Director</span></a>.</p>
<p>Three TAG participants are appointed by the Director. Appointees are
<span class="rfc2119">NOT REQUIRED</span> to be on the W3C Team. The Director
<span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> appoint <a href="#fellows">W3C Fellows</a> to
the TAG.</p>
<p>The remaining five TAG participants are elected by the W3C Advisory
Committee following the <a href="#AB-TAG-elections">AB/TAG nomination and
election process</a>.</p>
<p>With the exception of the Chair, the terms of all TAG participants are for
<span class="time-interval">two years</span>. Terms are staggered so that each
year, either two or three elected terms, and either one or two appointed terms
expire. If an individual is appointed or elected to fill an incomplete term,
that individual's term ends at the normal expiration date of that term. Regular
TAG terms begin on 1 February and end on 31 January.</p>
<h3>2.5 <a name="AB-TAG-participation" id="AB-TAG-participation">Advisory Board
and Technical Architecture Group Participation</a></h3>
<p>Advisory Board and TAG participants have a special role within W3C: they are
elected by the Membership and appointed by the Director with the expectation
that they will use their best judgment to find the best solutions for the Web,
not just for any particular network, technology, vendor, or user. Advisory
Board and TAG participants are expected to participate regularly and fully.
<a href="#good-standing">Good Standing</a> rules as defined for Working Group
participants also apply to Advisory Board and TAG participants. Advisory Board
and TAG participants <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> attend <a href="#ACMeetings">Advisory Committee meetings</a>.</p>
<p>An individual participates on the Advisory Board or TAG from the moment the
individual's term begins until the term ends or the seat is <a href="#AB-TAG-vacated">vacated</a>. Although Advisory Board and TAG participants do
not advocate for the commercial interests of their employers, their
participation does carry the responsibilities associated with Member
representation, Invited Expert status, or Team representation (as described in
the section on the <a href="#AB-TAG-elections">AB/TAG nomination and election
process</a>). See also the licensing obligations on TAG participants in
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy#sec-Obligations">section
3</a> of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy">W3C Patent
Policy</a> [<a href="#ref-patentpolicy">PUB33</a>], and the claim exclusion
process of <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy#sec-Exclusion">section 4</a>.</p>
<h4>2.5.1 <a id="AB-TAG-constraints" name="AB-TAG-constraints">Advisory Board
and Technical Architecture Group Participation Constraints</a></h4>
<p>Given the few seats available on the Advisory Board and the TAG, and in
order to ensure that the diversity of W3C Members is represented:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Member organization is permitted at most one participant on the TAG.</li>
<li>A Member organization is permitted at most one participant on the AB.</li>
<li>An individual <span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> participate on both the
TAG and the AB.</li>
</ul>
<p>If, for whatever reason, these constraints are not satisfied (e.g., because
a TAG or AB participant changes jobs), one participant <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> cease TAG or AB participation until the situation has
been resolved. If after <span class="time-interval">30 days</span> the
situation has not been resolved, the Chair will declare one participant's seat
to be vacant. When more than one individual is involved, the <a href="#random">verifiable random selection procedure</a> described below will be
used to choose one person for continued participation.</p>
<h4>2.5.2 <a id="AB-TAG-elections" name="AB-TAG-elections">Advisory Board and
Technical Architecture Group Elections</a></h4>
<p>The Advisory Board and a portion of the Technical Architecture Group are
elected by the Advisory Committee. An election begins when the Team sends a
Call for Nominations to the Advisory Committee. Any Call for Nominations
specifies the number of available seats, the deadline for nominations, and the
address where nominations are sent. The Director <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> announce appointments no later than the start of a
nomination period, and generally as part of the Call for Nominations.</p>
<p>Each Member (or group of <a href="#MemberRelated">related Members</a>)
<span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> nominate one individual. A nomination
<span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be made with the consent of the nominee. In
order for an individual to be nominated as a Member representative, the
individual <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> qualify for <a href="#member-rep">Member representation</a> and the Member's Advisory Committee

(same) <a href="#member-rep-info">information required for a Member
representative in a Working Group</a>. In order for an individual to be
nominated as an Invited Expert, the individual <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> provide the (same) <a href="#inv-expert-info">information
required for an Invited Expert in a Working Group</a> and the nominating
Advisory Committee representative <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> include
that information in the nomination. In order for an individual to be nominated
as a Team representative, the nominating Advisory Committee representative
<span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> first secure approval from Team management. A
nominee is <span class="rfc2119">NOT REQUIRED</span> to be an employee of a
Member organization, and <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> be a <a href="#fellows">W3C Fellow</a>. Each nomination <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span>
include a few informative paragraphs about the nominee.</p>
<p>If, after the deadline for nominations, the number of nominees is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Equal to the number of available seats, those nominees are thereby elected.
This situation constitutes a tie for the purposes of assigning <a href="#short-term">short terms</a>.</li>
<li>Less than the number of available seats, Calls for Nominations are issued
until a sufficient number of people have been nominated. Those already
nominated do not need to be renominated after a renewed call.</li>
<li>Greater than the number of available seats, the Team issues a Call for
Votes that includes the names of all candidates, the number of available seats,
the deadline for votes, and the address where votes are sent.</li>
</ul>
<p>When there is a vote, each Member (or group of <a href="#MemberRelated">related Members</a>) <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> vote for
as many candidates as there are available seats; see the section on <a href="#ACVotes">Advisory Committee votes</a>. Once the deadline for votes has
passed, the Team announces the results to the Advisory Committee. The
candidates with the most votes are elected to the available seats. In case of a
tie where there are more apparent winners than available seats (e.g., three
candidates receive 10 votes each for two seats), the <a href="#random">verifiable random selection procedure</a> described below will be
used to fill the available seats.</p>
<p id="short-term">The shortest term is assigned to the elected individual who
received the fewest votes, the next shortest to the elected individual who
received the next fewest, and so on. In the case of a tie among those eligible
for a short term, the <a href="#random">verifiable random selection
procedure</a> described below will be used to assign the short term.</p>
<p>Refer to <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/10/election-howto">How to Organize
an Advisory Board or TAG election</a> [<a href="#ref-election-howto">MEM15</a>]
for more details.</p>
<h5>2.5.2.1 <a name="random" id="random">Verifiable Random Selection
Procedure</a></h5>
<p>When it is necessary to use a verifiable random selection process (e.g., in
an AB or TAG election, to "draw straws" in case of a tie or to fill a short
term), W3C uses the random and verifiable procedure defined in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2777.txt">RFC 2777</a> [<a href="#ref-RFC2777">RFC2777</a>]. The procedure orders an input list of names
(listed in alphabetical order by family name unless otherwise specified) into a
"result order."</p>
<p>W3C applies this procedure as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>When N people have tied for M (less than N) seats. In this case, only the
names of the N individuals who tied are provided as input to the procedure. The
M seats are assigned in result order.</li>
<li>After all elected individuals have been identified, when N people are
eligible for M (less than N) short terms. In this case, only the names of those
N individuals are provided as input to the procedure. The short terms are
assigned in result order.</li>
</ol>
<h4>2.5.3 <a id="AB-TAG-vacated" name="AB-TAG-vacated">Advisory Board and
Technical Architecture Group Vacated Seats</a></h4>
<p>An Advisory Board or TAG participant's seat is vacated when either of the
following occurs:</p>
<ul>
<li>the participant <a href="#resignation">resigns</a>, or</li>
<li>the Chair asks the participant to <a href="#resignation">resign</a>, for
example because the participant has failed to remain in <a href="#good-standing">Good Standing</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When an Advisory Board or TAG participant changes affiliations, as long as
<a href="#AB-TAG-constraints">Advisory Board and TAG participation
constraints</a> are respected, the individual <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
continue to participate until the next regularly scheduled election for that
group. Otherwise, the seat is vacated.</p>
<p>Vacated seats are filled according to this schedule:</p>
<ul>
<li>When an appointed TAG seat is vacated, the Director <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> re-appoint someone immediately, but no later than the next
regularly scheduled election.</li>
<li>When an elected seat on either the AB or TAG is vacated, the seat is filled
at the next regularly scheduled election for the group unless the group Chair
requests that W3C hold an election before then (for instance, due to the
group's workload). The group Chair <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD NOT</span>
request an exceptional election if the next regularly scheduled election is
fewer than three months away.</li>

<h2>3 <a name="Policies" id="Policies">General Policies for W3C Groups</a></h2>
<p>This section describes general policies for W3C groups regarding
participation, meeting requirements, and decision-making. These policies apply
to <a name="participant" id="participant">participants</a> in the following
groups: <a href="#AC">Advisory Committee</a>, <a href="#ABParticipation">Advisory Board</a>, <a href="#tag-participation">TAG</a>,
<a href="#wgparticipant">Working Groups</a>, <a href="#igparticipant">Interest
Groups</a>, and <a href="#cgparticipant">Coordination Groups</a>.</p>
<h3>3.1 <a name="ParticipationCriteria" id="ParticipationCriteria">Individual
Participation Criteria</a></h3>
<p>There are three qualities an individual is expected to demonstrate in order
to participate in W3C:</p>
<ol>
<li>Technical competence in one's role</li>
<li>The ability to act fairly</li>
<li>Social competence in one's role</li>
</ol>
<p>Advisory Committee representatives who nominate individuals from their
organization for participation in W3C Activities are responsible for assessing
and attesting to the qualities of those nominees.</p>
<p>See also the participation requirements described in <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy#sec-Disclosure">section 6</a> of
the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy">W3C Patent Policy</a>
[<a href="#ref-patentpolicy">PUB33</a>].</p>
<h4>3.1.1 <a name="coi" id="coi">Conflict of Interest Policy</a></h4>
<p>Individuals participating materially in W3C work <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> disclose significant relationships when those
relationships might reasonably be perceived as creating a conflict of interest
with the individual's role at W3C. These disclosures <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be kept up-to-date as the individual's affiliations
change and W3C membership evolves (since, for example, the individual might
have a relationship with an organization that joins or leaves W3C). Each
section in this document that describes a W3C group provides more detail about
the disclosure mechanisms for that group.</p>
<p>The ability of an individual to fulfill a role within a group without
risking a conflict of interest is clearly a function of the individual's
affiliations. When these affiliations change, the individual's assignment to
the role <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be evaluated. The role <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> be reassigned according to the appropriate process. For
instance, the Director <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> appoint a new group
Chair when the current Chair changes affiliations (e.g., if there is a risk of
conflict of interest, or if there is risk that the Chair's new employer will be
over-represented within a W3C Activity).</p>
<p>The following are some scenarios where disclosure is appropriate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paid consulting for an organization whose activity is relevant to W3C, or
any consulting compensated with equity (shares of stock, stock options, or
other forms of corporate equity).</li>
<li>A decision-making role/responsibility (such as participating on the Board)
in other organizations relevant to W3C.</li>
<li>A position on a publicly visible advisory body, even if no decision making
authority is involved.</li>
</ul>
<p>Individuals seeking assistance on these matters <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> contact the Team.</p>
<p>Team members are subject to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/06-conflictpolicy">W3C Team conflict of interest
policy</a> [<a href="#ref-coi">PUB23</a>].</p>
<h4>3.1.2 <a name="member-rep" id="member-rep">Individuals Representing a
Member Organization</a></h4>
<p>Generally, individuals representing a Member in an official capacity within
W3C are employees of the Member organization. However, an Advisory Committee
representative <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> designate a non-employee to
represent the Member. Non-employee Member representatives <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> disclose relevant affiliations to the Team and to any
group in which the individual participates.</p>
<p>In exceptional circumstances (e.g., situations that might jeopardize the
progress of a group or create a <a href="#coi">conflict of interest</a>), the
<a href="#def-Director" rel="glossary" title="Definition of Director"><span class="dfn-instance">Director</span></a>
<span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> decline to allow an individual designated by
an Advisory Committee representative to participate in a group.</p>
<p>A group charter <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> limit the number of
individuals representing a W3C Member (or group of <a href="#MemberRelated">related Members</a>).</p>
<h3>3.2 <a name="GeneralMeetings" id="GeneralMeetings">Meetings</a></h3>
<p>W3C groups (including the <a href="#ACMeetings">Advisory Committee</a>,
<a href="#AB">Advisory Board</a>, <a href="#TAG">TAG</a>, and <a href="#GroupsWG">Working Groups</a>) <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> observe the
meeting requirements in this section.</p>
<p>W3C distinguishes two types of meetings:</p>
<ol>
<li>A <a name="ftf-meeting" id="ftf-meeting">face-to-face meeting</a> is one
where most of the attendees are expected to participate in the same physical
location.</li>
<li>A <a name="distributed-meeting" id="distributed-meeting">distributed
meeting</a> is one where most of the attendees are expected to participate from
remote locations (e.g., by telephone, video conferencing, or <acronym title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</acronym>).</li>
</ol>
<p>A Chair <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> invite an individual with a
particular expertise to attend a meeting on an exceptional basis. This person
is a meeting guest, not a group <a href="#participant">participant</a>. Meeting
guests do not have <a href="#Votes">voting rights</a>. It is the responsibility
of the Chair to ensure that all meeting guests respect the chartered <a href="#confidentiality-levels">level of confidentiality</a> and other group
requirements.</p>
<p>Meeting announcements <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> be sent to all
appropriate group mailing lists, i.e., those most relevant to the anticipated
meeting participants.</p>
<p>The following table lists requirements for organizing a meeting:</p>

</table>
<p><sup>*</sup> To allow proper planning (e.g., travel arrangements), the Chair
is responsible for giving sufficient advance notice about the date and location
of a meeting. Shorter notice for a meeting is allowed provided that there are
no objections from group participants.</p>
<h3>3.3 <a name="Consensus" id="Consensus">Consensus</a></h3>
<p>Consensus is a core value of W3C. To promote consensus, the W3C process
requires Chairs to ensure that groups consider all legitimate views and
objections, and endeavor to resolve them, whether these views and objections
are expressed by the active participants of the group or by others (e.g.,
another W3C group, a group in another organization, or the general public).
Decisions <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> be made during meetings (<a href="#ftf-meeting">face-to-face</a> or <a href="#distributed-meeting">distributed</a>) as well as through email.
<strong>Note:</strong> The Director, W3C Chair, and COO have the role of
assessing consensus within the Advisory Committee.</p>
<p>The following terms are used in this document to describe the level of
support for a decision among a set of eligible individuals:</p>
<ol>
<li><a name="def-Consensus" id="def-Consensus"><dfn><b>Consensus</b></dfn></a>:
A substantial number of individuals in the set support the decision and nobody
in the set registers a <a href="#FormalObjection">Formal Objection</a>.
Individuals in the set may abstain. Abstention is either an explicit expression
of no opinion or silence by an individual in the set. <a name="def-Unanimity" id="def-Unanimity"><dfn><b>Unanimity</b></dfn></a> is the particular case of
consensus where all individuals in the set support the decision (i.e., no
individual in the set abstains).</li>
<li><a name="def-Dissent" id="def-Dissent"><dfn><b>Dissent</b></dfn></a>: At
least one individual in the set registers a <a href="#FormalObjection">Formal
Objection</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>By default, the set of individuals eligible to participate in a decision is
the set of group participants in <a href="#good-standing">Good Standing</a>.
The Process Document does not require a quorum for decisions (i.e., the minimal
number of eligible participants required to be present before the Chair can
call a question). A charter <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> include a quorum
requirement for consensus decisions.</p>
<p>Where unanimity is not possible, a group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span>
strive to make consensus decisions where there is significant support and few
abstentions. The Process Document does not require a particular percentage of
eligible participants to agree to a motion in order for a decision to be made.
To avoid decisions where there is widespread apathy, (i.e., little support and
many abstentions), groups <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> set minimum
thresholds of active support before a decision can be recorded. The appropriate
percentage <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> vary depending on the size of the
group and the nature of the decision. A charter <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> include threshold requirements for consensus decisions.
For instance, a charter might require a supermajority of eligible participants
(i.e., some established percentage above 50%) to support certain types of
consensus decisions.</p>
<h4>3.3.1 <a name="managing-dissent" id="managing-dissent">Managing
Dissent</a></h4>
<p>In some cases, even after careful consideration of all points of view, a
group might find itself unable to reach consensus. The Chair <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> record a decision where there is dissent (i.e., there is
at least one <a href="#FormalObjection">Formal Objection</a>) so that the group
may make progress (for example, to produce a deliverable in a timely manner).
Dissenters cannot stop a group's work simply by saying that they cannot live
with a decision. When the Chair believes that the Group has duly considered the
legitimate concerns of dissenters as far as is possible and reasonable, the
group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> move on.</p>
<p>Groups <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> favor proposals that create the
weakest objections. This is preferred over proposals that are supported by a
large majority but that cause strong objections from a few people. As part of
making a decision where there is dissent, the Chair is expected to be aware of
which participants work for the same (or <a href="#MemberRelated">related</a>)
Member organizations and weigh their input accordingly.</p>
<h4>3.3.2 <a name="WGArchiveMinorityViews" id="WGArchiveMinorityViews">Recording and Reporting Formal Objections</a></h4>
<p>In the W3C process, an individual may register a Formal Objection to a
decision. A <a id="FormalObjection" name="FormalObjection">Formal Objection</a>
to a group decision is one that the reviewer requests that the Director
consider as part of evaluating the related decision (e.g., in response to a
<a href="#rec-advance">request to advance</a> a technical report).
<strong>Note:</strong> In this document, the term "Formal Objection" is used to
emphasize this process implication: Formal Objections receive Director
consideration. The word "objection" used alone has ordinary English
connotations.</p>
<p>An individual who registers a Formal Objection <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> cite technical arguments and propose changes that would
remove the Formal Objection; these proposals <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
be vague or incomplete. Formal Objections that do not provide substantive
arguments or rationale are unlikely to receive serious consideration by the
Director.</p>
<p>A record of each Formal Objection <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be
<a href="#confidentiality-change">publicly available</a>. A Call for Review (of
a document) to the Advisory Committee <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
identify any Formal Objections.</p>
<h4>3.3.3 <a name="formal-address" id="formal-address">Formally Addressing an
Issue</a></h4>
<p>In the context of this document, a group has formally addressed an issue
when it has sent a public, substantive response to the reviewer who raised the
issue. A substantive response is expected to include rationale for decisions
(e.g., a technical explanation, a pointer to charter scope, or a pointer to a
requirements document). The adequacy of a response is measured against what a
W3C reviewer would generally consider to be technically sound. If a group
believes that a reviewer's comments result from a misunderstanding, the group
<span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> seek clarification before reaching a
decision.</p>
<p>As a courtesy, both Chairs and reviewers <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span>
set expectations for the schedule of responses and acknowledgments. The group
<span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> reply to a reviewer's initial comments in a
timely manner. The group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> set a time limit
for acknowledgment by a reviewer of the group's substantive response; a
reviewer cannot block a group's progress. It is common for a reviewer to
require a week or more to acknowledge and comment on a substantive response.
The group's responsibility to respond to reviewers does not end once a
reasonable amount of time has elapsed. However, reviewers <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> realize that their comments will carry less weight if
not sent to the group in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Substantive responses <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> be recorded. The
group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> maintain an accurate summary of all
substantive issues and responses to them (e.g., in the form of an issues list
with links to mailing list archives).</p>
<h4>3.3.4 <a name="WGChairReopen" id="WGChairReopen">Reopening a Decision When
Presented With New Information</a></h4>
<p>The Chair <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> reopen a decision when presented
with new information, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>additional technical information,</li>
<li>comments by email from participants who were unable to attend a scheduled
meeting,</li>
<li>comments by email from meeting attendees who chose not to speak out during
a meeting (e.g., so they could confer later with colleagues or for cultural
reasons).</li>
</ul>
<p>The Chair <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> record that a decision has
been reopened, and <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> do so upon request from a
group participant.</p>
<h3>3.4 <a name="Votes" id="Votes">Votes</a></h3>
<p>A group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> only conduct a vote to resolve a
<em>substantive issue</em> after the Chair has determined that all available
means of <a href="#Consensus">reaching consensus</a> through technical
discussion and compromise have failed, and that a vote is necessary to break a
deadlock. In this case the Chair <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> record
(e.g., in the minutes of the meeting or in an archived email message):</p>
<ul>
<li>an explanation of the issue being voted on;</li>
<li>the decision to conduct a vote (e.g., a simple majority vote) to resolve
the issue;</li>
<li>the outcome of the vote;</li>
<li>any Formal Objections.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to vote to resolve a substantive issue, an individual <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be a group <a href="#participant">participant</a> in
<a href="#good-standing">Good Standing</a>. Each organization represented in
the group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> have at most one vote, even when
the organization is represented by several participants in the group (including
Invited Experts). For the purposes of voting:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Member or group of <a href="#MemberRelated">related Members</a> is
considered a single organization.</li>
<li>The <a href="#Team">Team</a> is considered an organization.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unless the charter states otherwise, <a href="#invited-expert-wg">Invited
Experts</a> <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> vote.</p>
<p>If a participant is unable to attend a vote, that individual <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> authorize anyone at the meeting to act as a <a name="proxy" id="proxy">proxy</a>. The absent participant <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> inform the Chair in writing who is acting as proxy, with
written instructions on the use of the proxy. For a Working Group or Interest
Group, see the related requirements regarding an individual who attends a
meeting as a <a href="#mtg-substitute">substitute</a> for a participant.</p>
<p>A group <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> vote for other purposes than to
resolve a substantive issue. For instance, the Chair often conducts a "straw
poll" vote as a means of determining whether there is consensus about a
potential decision.</p>
<p>A group <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> also vote to make a process
decision. For example, it is appropriate to decide by simple majority whether
to hold a meeting in San Francisco or San Jose (there's not much difference
geographically). When simple majority votes are used to decide minor issues,
the minority are <span class="rfc2119">NOT REQUIRED</span> to state the reasons
for their dissent, and the group is <span class="rfc2119">NOT REQUIRED</span>
to record individual votes.</p>
<p>A group charter <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> include formal voting
procedures (e.g., quorum or threshold requirements) for making decisions about
substantive issues.</p>
<p>Procedures for <a href="#ACVotes">Advisory Committee votes</a> are described
separately.</p>
<h3>3.5 <a name="WGAppeals" id="WGAppeals">Appeal of a Chair's
Decision</a></h3>
<p>Groups resolve issues through dialog. Individuals who disagree strongly with
a decision <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> register with the Chair any
<a href="#FormalObjection">Formal Objections</a> (e.g., to a decision made as
the result of a <a href="#Votes">vote</a>).</p>
<p>When group participants believe that their concerns are not being duly
considered by the group, they <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> ask the <a href="#def-Director" rel="glossary" title="Definition of Director"><span class="dfn-instance">Director</span></a> (for representatives of a Member
organization, via their Advisory Committee representative) to confirm or deny
the decision. The participants <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> also make
their requests known to the <a href="#TeamContact">Team Contact</a>. The Team
Contact <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> inform the Director when a group
participant has raised concerns about due process.</p>
<p>Any requests to the Director to confirm a decision <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> include a summary of the issue (whether technical or
procedural), decision, and rationale for the objection. All counter-arguments,
rationales, and decisions <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be recorded.</p>
<p>Procedures for <a href="#ACAppeal">Advisory Committee appeals</a> are
described separately.</p>
<h3>3.6 <a name="resignation" id="resignation">Resignation from a
Group</a></h3>
<p>A W3C Member or Invited Expert <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> resign from
a group. The Team will establish administrative procedures for resignation. See
section 4.2. of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy">W3C

<p>Those authorized to access Member-only and Team-only information:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> treat the information as confidential
within W3C,</li>
<li><span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> use reasonable efforts to maintain the
proper level confidentiality, and</li>
<li><span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> release this information to the
general public or press.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> provide mechanisms to protect the
confidentiality of Member-only information and ensure that authorized parties
have proper access to this information. Documents <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> clearly indicate whether they require Member-only
confidentiality. Individuals uncertain of the confidentiality level of a piece
of information <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> contact the Team.</p>
<p>Advisory Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
authorize Member-only access to <a href="#member-rep">Member
representatives</a> and other individuals employed by the Member who are
considered appropriate recipients. For instance, it is the responsibility of
the Advisory Committee representative and other employees and official
representatives of the organization to ensure that Member-only news
announcements are distributed for internal use only within their organization.
Information about Member mailing lists is available in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Member/Intro">New Member Orientation</a>.</p>
<h4>4.1.1 <a name="confidentiality-change" id="confidentiality-change">Changing
Confidentiality Level</a></h4>
<p>As a benefit of membership, W3C provides some Team-only and Member-only
channels for certain types of communication. For example, Advisory Committee
representatives can send <a href="#ACReview">reviews</a> to a Team-only
channel. However, for W3C processes with a significant public component, such
as the technical report development process, it is also important for
information that affects decision-making to be publicly available. The Team
<span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> need to communicate Team-only information to a
Working Group or the public. Similarly, a Working Group whose proceedings are
Member-only <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> make public information pertinent
to the technical report development process.</p>
<p>This document clearly indicates which information <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be available to Members or the public, even though that
information was initially communicated on Team-only or Member-only channels.
Only the Team and parties authorized by the Team change the level of
confidentiality of this information. When doing so:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> use a version of the information
that was expressly provided by the author for the new confidentiality level. In
Calls for Review and other similar messages, the Team <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> remind recipients to provide such alternatives.</li>
<li>The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> attribute the version for
the new confidentiality level to the author without the author's consent.</li>
<li>If the author has not conveyed to the Team a version that is suitable for
another confidentiality level, the Team <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> make
available a version that reasonably communicates what is required, while
respecting the original level of confidentiality, and without attribution to
the original author.</li>

<h2>5 <a name="Activities" id="Activities">Activities</a></h2>
<p>This section describes the mechanisms for establishing consensus within the
areas of Web development the Consortium chooses to pursue. An <a name="def-Activity" id="def-Activity"><dfn><b>Activity</b></dfn></a> organizes the
work necessary for the development or evolution of a Web technology.</p>
<p>W3C starts an Activity based on interest from the Members and Team. W3C
Members build interest around new work through discussions among Advisory
Committee representatives, Chairs, and Team, and through the <a href="#Submission">Submission process</a>. The Team tracks Web developments inside
and outside W3C, manages <a href="#Liaisons">liaisons</a>, and organizes
<a href="#EventsW">Workshops</a>.</p>
<p>Based on input from the Team and Members about the structure and scope of an
Activity, the Team sends an <a href="#ActivityProposal">Activity Proposal</a>
to the Advisory Committee. This is a proposal to dedicate Team and Member
resources to a particular area of Web technology or policy, and when there is
consensus about the motivation, scope, and structure of the proposed work, W3C
starts a new Activity.</p>
<p>Each Activity has its own structure that generally includes Working Groups,
Interest Groups, and Coordination Groups. Within the framework of an Activity,
these groups produce technical reports, review the work of other groups, and
develop sample code or test suites.</p>
<p>The progress of each Activity is documented in an <a name="ActivityStatement" id="ActivityStatement">Activity Statement</a>. Activity
Statements describe the goals of the Activity, completed and unfinished
deliverables, changing perspectives based on experience, and future plans. At
least before each <a href="#ACMeetings">Advisory Committee meeting</a>, the
Team <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> revise the Activity Statement for each
Activity that has not been closed.</p>
<p>Refer to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/activities">list of W3C
Activities</a> [<a href="#ref-activity-list">PUB9</a>]. <strong>Note:</strong>
This list <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> include some Activities that began
prior to the formalization in 1997 of the Activity creation process.</p>
<h3>5.1 <a name="ActivityDevelopment" id="ActivityDevelopment">Activity
Proposal Development</a></h3>
<p>The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> notify the Advisory Committee
when a proposal for a new or modified Activity is in development. This is
intended to raise awareness, even if no formal proposal is yet available.
Advisory Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> express
their general support on the <a href="#ACCommunication">Advisory Committee
discussion list</a>. The Team <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> incorporate
discussion points into an Activity Proposal. Refer to additional <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/05/rec-tips">tips on getting to Recommendation
faster</a> [<a href="#ref-rec-tips">PUB27</a>].</p>
<h3>5.2 <a name="ActivityCreation" id="ActivityCreation">Advisory Committee
Review</a> of an Activity Proposal</h3>
<p>The Director <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> solicit <a href="#ReviewAppeal">Advisory Committee review</a> of every proposal to create,
substantively modify, or extend an Activity.</p>
<p>After a Call for Review from the Director, the Advisory Committee <a href="#ACReview">reviews</a> and comments on the proposal. The review period
<span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be at least <span class="time-interval">four
weeks</span>.</p>
<p>The Director announces to the Advisory Committee whether there is consensus
within W3C to create or modify the Activity (possibly with changes suggested
during the review). For a new Activity, this announcement officially creates
the Activity. This announcement <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> include a
<a href="#cfp">Call for Participation</a> in any groups created as part of the
Activity.</p>
<p>If there was <a href="#def-Dissent" rel="glossary" title="Definition of Dissent"><span class="dfn-instance">dissent</span></a>, Advisory
Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> <a href="#ACAppeal">appeal</a> a decision to create, modify, or extend the Activity.
<strong>Note:</strong> There is no appeal of a decision <em>not</em> to create
an Activity; in general, drafting a new Activity Proposal will be simpler than
following the appeal process.</p>
<h3>5.3 <a name="ActivityModification" id="ActivityModification">Modification
of an Activity</a></h3>
<p>Activities are intended to be flexible. W3C expects participants to be able
to adapt in the face of new ideas (e.g., Member Submission requests) and
increased understanding of goals and context, while remaining true to the
intent of the original Activity Proposal. If it becomes necessary to make
substantive changes to an Activity (e.g., because significant additional
resources are necessary or because the Activity's scope has clearly changed
from the original proposal), then the Director <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> solicit <a href="#ActivityCreation">Advisory Committee
review</a> of a complete <a href="#BPCreation">Activity Proposal</a>, including
rationale for the changes.</p>
<h3>5.4 <a name="ActivityExtension" id="ActivityExtension">Extension of an
Activity</a></h3>
<p>When the Director solicits <a href="#ActivityCreation">Advisory Committee
review</a> of a proposal to extend the duration of an Activity with no other
substantive modifications to the composition of the Activity, the proposal
<span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> indicate the new duration and include
rationale for the extension. The Director is <span class="rfc2119">NOT
REQUIRED</span> to submit a complete <a href="#BPCreation">Activity
Proposal</a>.</p>
<h3>5.5 <a name="ActivityTermination" id="ActivityTermination">Activity
Closure</a></h3>
<p>An Activity Proposal specifies a duration for the Activity. The Director,
subject to <a href="#ACAppeal">appeal</a> by Advisory Committee
representatives, <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> close an Activity prior to
the date specified in the proposal in any of the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Groups in the Activity fail to produce chartered deliverables.</li>
<li>Groups in the Activity produce chartered deliverables ahead of
schedule.</li>
<li>There are insufficient resources to maintain the Activity, according to
priorities established within W3C.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Director closes an Activity by announcement to the Advisory
Committee.</p>
<h3>5.6 <a name="BPCreation" id="BPCreation"></a><a name="ActivityProposal" id="ActivityProposal">Activity Proposals</a></h3>
<p>An Activity Proposal defines the initial scope and structure of an Activity.
The proposal <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> include or reference the
following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Activity summary. What is the nature of the Activity (e.g., to track
developments, create technical reports, develop code, organize pilot
experiments, or for education)? Who or what group wants this (providers or
users)?</li>
<li>Context information. Why is this Activity being proposed now? What is the
situation in the world (e.g., with respect to the Web community, market,
research, or society)? within the scope of the proposal? Who or what currently
exists that is pertinent to this Activity? Is the community
mature/growing/developing a niche? What competing technologies exist? What
competing organizations exist?</li>
<li>A description of the Activity's scope. How might a potential Recommendation
interact and overlap with existing international standards and Recommendations?
What organizations are likely to be affected by potential overlap (see the
section on <a href="#Liaisons">liaisons with other organizations</a>)? What
should be changed if the Activity is approved?</li>
<li>A description of the Activity's initial deployment, including:
<ul>
<li>The duration of the Activity.</li>
<li>What <a href="#GAGroups">groups</a> will be created as part of this
Activity and how those groups will be coordinated. For each group, the proposal
<span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> include a provisional charter. Groups
<span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> be scheduled to run concurrently or
sequentially (either because of a dependency or an expected overlap in
membership and the desirability of working on one subject at a time). These
charters <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> be amended based on review comments
before the Director issues a <a href="#cfp">Call for Participation</a>.</li>
<li>The expected timeline of the Activity, including proposed deliverable dates
and scheduled <a href="#GAEvents">Workshops and Symposia</a>.</li>
<li>If known, the date of the first <a href="#ftf-meeting">face-to-face
meeting</a> of each proposed group. The date of the first face-to-face meeting
of a proposed group <span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> be sooner than
<span class="time-interval">eight weeks</span> after the date of the <a href="#ActivityProposal">Activity Proposal</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A summary of resources (Member, Team, administrative, technical, and
financial) expected to be dedicated to the Activity. The proposal <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> specify the threshold level of effort that Members are
expected to pledge in order for the Activity to be accepted.</li>
<li>Information about known dependencies within W3C or outside of W3C.</li>
<li>Intellectual property information. What are the intellectual property
(including patents and copyright) considerations affecting the success of the
Activity? In particular, is there any reason to believe that it will be
difficult to meet the Royalty-Free licensing goals of section 2 of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy">W3C Patent Policy</a> [<a href="#ref-patentpolicy">PUB33</a>]?</li>
<li>A list of supporters and references. What community is expected to benefit
from this Activity? Are members of this community part of W3C now? Are they
expected to join the effort?</li>

<h2>6 <a name="GAGeneral" id="GAGeneral">Working Groups, Interest Groups, and
Coordination Groups</a></h2>
<p><a name="GAGroups" id="GAGroups">This document defines three types of
groups:</a></p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#GroupsWG">Working Groups.</a> Working Groups typically produce
deliverables (e.g., <a href="#rec-advance">Recommendation Track technical
reports</a>, software, test suites, and reviews of the deliverables of other
groups). There are <a href="#good-standing">Good Standing</a> requirements for
Working Group participation as well as additional participation requirements
described in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy">W3C
Patent Policy</a> [<a href="#ref-patentpolicy">PUB33</a>].</li>
<li><a href="#GroupsIG">Interest Groups.</a> The primary goal of an Interest
Group is to bring together people who wish to evaluate potential Web
technologies and policies. An Interest Group is a forum for the exchange of
ideas.</li>
<li><a href="#GroupsCG">Coordination Groups.</a> A Coordination Group manages
dependencies and facilitates communication with other groups, within or outside
of W3C.</li>
</ol>
<p>Neither Interest Groups nor Coordination Groups publish <a href="#rec-track-doc">Recommendation Track technical reports</a>; see information
about <a href="#ig-cg-notes">maturity levels for Interest Groups and
Coordination Groups</a>.</p>
<h3>6.1 <a name="ReqsAllGroups" id="ReqsAllGroups">Requirements for All
Working, Interest, and Coordination Groups</a></h3>
<p>Each group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> have a charter. Requirements
for the charter depend on the group type. All group charters <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be public (even if other proceedings of the group are
<a href="#Member-only">Member-only</a>). Existing charters that are not yet
public <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be made public when next revised or
extended (with attention to <a href="#confidentiality-change">changing
confidentiality level</a>).</p>
<p>Each group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> have a <a name="GeneralChairs" id="GeneralChairs">Chair</a> (or co-Chairs) to coordinate the group's tasks.
The Director appoints (and re-appoints) Chairs for all groups. The Chair is a
<a href="#member-rep">Member representative</a>, a <a href="#Team">Team
representative</a>, or an <a href="#invited-expert-wg">Invited Expert</a>
(invited by the Director). The requirements of this document that apply to
those types of participants apply to Chairs as well. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Guide/chair-roles">role of the Chair [MEM14]</a> is described in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Guide/">Member guide</a> [<a href="#ref-guide">MEM9</a>].</p>
<p>Each group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> have a <a name="TeamContact" id="TeamContact">Team Contact</a>, who acts as the interface between the Chair,
group participants, and the rest of the Team. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Guide/staff-contact">role of the Team Contact</a> is described in the Member
guide. The Chair and the Team Contact of a group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD
NOT</span> be the same individual.</p>
<p>Each group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> have an archived mailing list
for formal group communication (e.g., for meeting announcements and minutes,
documentation of decisions, and <a href="#FormalObjection">Formal
Objections</a> to decisions). It is the responsibility of the Chair and Team
Contact to ensure that new participants are subscribed to all relevant mailing
lists. Refer to the list of <a href="http://www.w3.org/Member/Mail/">group
mailing lists</a> [<a href="#ref-mailing-lists">MEM2</a>].</p>
<p>A Chair <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> form task forces (composed of group
participants) to carry out assignments for the group. The scope of these
assignments <span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> exceed the scope of the
group's charter. A group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> document the
process it uses to create task forces (e.g., each task force might have an
informal "charter"). Task forces do not publish <a href="#Reports">technical
reports</a>; the Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> choose to
publish their results as part of a technical report.</p>
<h3>6.2 <a name="GroupsWG" id="GroupsWG">Working Groups</a> and <a name="GroupsIG" id="GroupsIG">Interest Groups</a></h3>
<p>Although Working Groups and Interest Groups have different purposes, they
share some characteristics, and so are defined together in the following
sections.</p>
<h4>6.2.1 <a name="group-participation" id="group-participation">Working Group
and Interest Group Participation Requirements</a></h4>
<p>There are three types of individual <a name="wgparticipant" id="wgparticipant">participants in a Working Group</a>: <a href="#member-rep">Member representatives</a>, <a href="#invited-expert-wg">Invited
Experts</a>, and <a href="#Team">Team representatives</a> (including the
<a href="#TeamContact">Team Contact</a>).</p>
<p>There are four types of individual <a name="igparticipant" id="igparticipant">participants in an Interest Group</a>: the same three types as
for Working Groups plus, for an Interest Group where the only <a href="#ig-mail-only">participation requirement is mailing list subscription</a>,
<a name="public-participant-ig" id="public-participant-ig">public
participants</a>.</p>
<p>Except where noted in this document or in a group charter, all participants
share the same rights and responsibilities in a group; see also the <a href="#ParticipationCriteria">individual participation criteria</a>.</p>
<p>A participant <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> represent at most one
organization in a Working Group or Interest Group.</p>
<p>An individual <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> become a Working or Interest
Group participant at any time during the group's existence. See also relevant
requirements in <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy#sec-join">section 4.3</a> of the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy">W3C Patent Policy</a>
[<a href="#ref-patentpolicy">PUB33</a>].</p>
<p>On an exceptional basis, a Working or Interest Group participant
<span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> designate a <a name="mtg-substitute" id="mtg-substitute">substitute</a> to attend a <a href="#GeneralMeetings">meeting</a> and <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> inform
the Chair. The substitute <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> act on behalf of the
participant, including for <a href="#Votes">votes</a>. For the substitute to
vote, the participant <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> inform the Chair in
writing in advance. As a courtesy to the group, if the substitute is not
well-versed in the group's discussions, the regular participant <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> authorize another participant to act as <a href="#proxy">proxy</a> for votes. For the purposes of <a href="#good-standing">Good
Standing</a>, the regular representative and the substitute are considered the
same participant.</p>
<p>To allow rapid progress, Working Groups are intended to be small (typically
fewer than 15 people) and composed of experts in the area defined by the
charter. In principle, Interest Groups have no limit on the number of
participants. When a Working Group grows too large to be effective, W3C
<span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> split it into an Interest Group (a discussion
forum) and a much smaller Working Group (a core group of highly dedicated
participants).</p>
<p>See also the licensing obligations on Working Group participants in <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy#sec-Obligations">section 3</a> of
the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy">W3C Patent Policy</a>
[<a href="#ref-patentpolicy">PUB33</a>], and the patent claim exclusion process
of <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy#sec-Exclusion">section
4</a>.</p>
<h5>6.2.1.1 <a name="member-rep-wg" id="member-rep-wg">Member
Representative</a> in a Working Group</h5>
<p>An individual is a Member representative in a Working Group if all of the
following conditions are satisfied:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Advisory Committee representative of the Member in question has
designated the individual as a Working Group participant, and</li>
<li>the individual qualifies for <a href="#member-rep">Member

representative joins the group until either of the following occurs:</p>
<ul>
<li>the group closes, or</li>
<li>the Member <a href="#resignation">resigns</a> from the Working Group; this

<ul>
<li>the Advisory Committee representative of the Member in question has
designated the individual as an Interest Group participant, and</li>
<li>the individual qualifies for <a href="#member-rep">Member

</ul>
<p>To designate an individual as a Member representative in an Interest Group,
the Advisory Committee representative <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> follow
the instructions in the <a href="#cfp">Call for Participation</a> and

<p>Member participation in an Interest Group ceases under the same conditions
as for a Working Group.</p>
<h5>6.2.1.3 <a name="invited-expert-wg" id="invited-expert-wg">Invited
Expert</a> in a Working Group</h5>
<p>The Chair <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> invite an individual with a
particular expertise to participate in a Working Group. This individual
<span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> represent an organization in the group (e.g.,

</ul>
<p>To designate an individual as an Invited Expert in a Working Group, the
Chair <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> inform the Team Contact and provide
rationale for the choice. When the Chair and the Team Contact disagree about a
designation, the <a href="#def-Director" rel="glossary" title="Definition of Director"><span class="dfn-instance">Director</span></a>

<h5>6.2.1.5 <a name="team-rep-wg" id="team-rep-wg">Team Representative in a
Working Group</a></h5>
<p>An individual is a Team representative in a Working Group when so designated
by W3C management.</p>
<p>An Team representative participates in a Working Group from the moment the
individual joins the group until any of the following occurs:</p>
<ul>
<li>the group closes, or</li>
<li>W3C management changes Team representation by sending email to the Chair,

<li>attending most meetings of the Working Group.</li>
<li>providing deliverables or drafts of deliverables in a timely fashion.</li>
<li>being familiar with the relevant documents of the Working Group, including
minutes of past meetings.</li>
<li>following discussions on relevant mailing list(s).</li>
</ul>
<p>At the first Working Group meeting that follows any <a href="#cfp">Call for
Participation</a>, all participants are in Good Standing. If a Member or
Invited Expert joins the Working Group after the end of that meeting, the
Member Representative or Invited Expert does not attain Good Standing until the
start of the second consecutive meeting that individual attends.</p>
<p>When the Chair and the <a href="#TeamContact">Team Contact</a> agree, the
Chair <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> declare that a participant is no longer
in Good Standing (henceforth called "Bad Standing"). If there is disagreement
between the Chair and the Team Contact about standing, the Director determines
the participant's standing. The Chair <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> declare
a Team participant to be in Bad Standing, but it is clearly preferable for the
Chair, Team participant, and W3C management to resolve issues internally.</p>
<p>A participant <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> be declared in Bad Standing
in any of the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>the individual has missed more than one of the last three <a href="#distributed-meeting">distributed meetings</a>.</li>
<li>the individual has missed more than one of the last three <a href="#ftf-meeting">face-to-face meetings</a>.</li>
<li>the individual has not provided deliverables in a timely fashion twice in
sequence.</li>
<li>the individual has not followed the <a href="#coi">conflict of interest
policy</a> by disclosing information to the rest of the group.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although all participants representing an organization <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> attend all meetings, attendance by one representative
of an organization satisfies the meeting attendance requirement for all
representatives of the organization.</p>
<p>The above criteria <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> be relaxed if the Chair
and Team Contact agree that doing so will not set back the Working Group. For
example, the attendance requirement can be relaxed for reasons of expense
(e.g., cost of travel) or scheduling (for example, an exceptional
teleconference is scheduled at 3:00 a.m. local time for the participant). It is
the responsibility of the Chair and Team Contact to apply criteria for Good
Standing consistently.</p>
<p>When a participant risks losing Good Standing, the Chair and Team Contact
are expected to discuss the matter with the participant and the participant's
Advisory Committee representative (or W3C management for the Team) before
declaring the participant in Bad Standing.</p>
<p>The Chair declares a participant in Bad Standing by informing the
participant's Advisory Committee representative and the participant of the
decision. If the Advisory Committee representative and Chair differ in opinion,
the Advisory Committee representative <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> ask the
<a href="#def-Director" rel="glossary" title="Definition of Director"><span class="dfn-instance">Director</span></a> to
confirm or deny the decision. <a href="#invited-expert-wg">Invited Experts</a>
declared in Bad Standing <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> appeal to the
Director.</p>
<p>The Chair and Team Contact restore Good Standing and <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> do so when the individual in Bad Standing satisfies the
above criteria. The Chair <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> inform the
individual's Advisory Committee representative of any change in standing.</p>
<p>When a Member representative permanently replaces another (i.e., is not
simply a temporary <a href="#mtg-substitute">substitute</a>), the new
participant inherits the standing of the departing participant.</p>
<p>Changes in an individual's standing in a Working Group have no effect on the
obligations associated with Working Group participation that are described in
the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy">W3C Patent Policy</a>
[<a href="#ref-patentpolicy">PUB33</a>].</p>

<ul>
<li>The group's mission (e.g., develop a technology or process, review the work
of other groups);</li>
<li>The scope of the group's work and criteria for success;</li>
<li>The duration of the group (typically from six months to two years);</li>
<li>The nature of any deliverables (technical reports, reviews of the
deliverables of other groups, or software), expected milestones, and the
process for the group participants to approve the release of these deliverables
(including public intermediate results). A charter is <span class="rfc2119">NOT
REQUIRED</span> to include the schedule for a review of another group's

<li>Any dependencies of this group on other groups within or outside of W3C.
For example, one group's charter might specify that another group is expected
to review a technical report before it can become a Recommendation. For any
dependencies, the charter <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> specify when
required deliverables are expected from the other groups. The charter

<p id="ig-charter-participation">An Interest Group charter <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> include provisions regarding participation, including
specifying that the <a name="ig-mail-only" id="ig-mail-only">only requirement

<p>A charter <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> include provisions other than
those required by this document. The charter <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> highlight whether additional provisions impose
constraints beyond those of the W3C Process Document (e.g., limits on the
number of individuals in a Working Group who represent the same Member
organization or group of <a href="#MemberRelated">related Members</a>).</p>
<h4>6.2.7 <a name="three-month-rule" id="three-month-rule">Working Group
"Heartbeat" Requirement</a></h4>
<p>It is important that a Working Group keep the Membership and public informed
of its activity and progress. To this end, each Working Group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> publish in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/">W3C
technical reports index</a> a new draft of <em>each active technical
report</em> at least once every three months. An active technical report is a
Working Draft, Candidate Recommendation, Proposed Recommendation, or Proposed
Edited Recommendation. Each Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
publish a new draft of <em>at least one of its active technical reports</em> on
the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/">W3C technical reports index</a> [<a href="#ref-doc-list">PUB11</a>] at least once every three months.</p>
<p>Public progress reports are also important when a Working Group does not
update a technical report within three months (for example, when the delay is
due to a challenging technical issue) or when a Working Group has no active
technical reports (for example, because it is developing a test suite).</p>
<p>In exceptional cases, the Chair <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> ask the
Director to be excused from this publication requirement. However, in this
case, the Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> issue a public status
report with rationale why a new draft has not been published.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for this Working Group "heartbeat"
requirement:</p>
<ul>
<li>To promote public accountability;</li>
<li>To encourage Working Groups to keep moving forward, and to incorporate
their decisions into readable public documents. People cannot be expected to
read several months of a group's mailing list archive to understand where the
group stands;</li>
<li>To notify interested parties of updated work in familiar a place such as
the W3C home page and index of technical reports.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example, suppose a Working Group has one technical report as a
deliverable, which it publishes as a Proposed Recommendation. Per the heartbeat
requirement, the Working Group is required to publish a new draft of the
Proposed Recommendation at least once every three months, even if it is only to
revise the status of the Proposed Recommendation document (e.g., to provide an
update on the status of the decision to advance). The heartbeat requirement
stops when the document becomes a Recommendation (or a Working Group Note).</p>
<h4>6.2.8 <a name="GeneralTermination" id="GeneralTermination">Working Group
and Interest Group Closure</a></h4>
<p>A Working Group or Interest Group charter specifies a duration for the
group. The Director, subject to <a href="#ACAppeal">appeal</a> by Advisory
Committee representatives, <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> close a group prior
to the date specified in the charter in any of the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are insufficient resources to produce chartered deliverables or to
maintain the group, according to priorities established within W3C.</li>
<li>The group produces chartered deliverables ahead of schedule.</li>
<li>The Activity to which the group belongs terminates.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Director closes a Working Group or Interest Group by announcement to the
Advisory Committee.</p>
<p>Closing a Working Group has implications with respect to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy">W3C Patent Policy</a> [<a href="#ref-patentpolicy">PUB33</a>].</p>
<h3>6.3 <a name="GroupsCG" id="GroupsCG">Coordination Groups</a></h3>
<p>W3C Activities interact in many ways. There are dependencies between groups
within the same Activity or in different Activities. There are also
dependencies between W3C Activities and the activities of other organizations.
Examples of dependencies include the use by one technology of another being
developed elsewhere, scheduling constraints between groups, and the
synchronization of publicity for the announcement of deliverables. Coordination
Groups are created to manage dependencies so that issues are resolved fairly
and the solutions are consistent with W3C's mission and results.</p>
<p>Where a Coordination Group's scope covers two groups with unresolved
disputes or tensions, it is the first locus of resolution of these
disputes.</p>
<h4>6.3.1 <a name="CGParticipation" id="CGParticipation">Coordination Group
Participation Requirements</a></h4>
<p>There are four types <a name="cgparticipant" id="cgparticipant">participants
in a Coordination Group</a>: the <a href="#GeneralChairs">Chair</a>, the Chair
of each coordinated group (to promote effective communication among the
groups), Invited Experts (e.g., liaisons to groups inside or outside W3C), and
Team representatives (including the <a href="#TeamContact">Team Contact</a>).
The requirements for Invited Expert participation are the same as for an
<a href="#invited-expert-wg">Invited Expert in a Working Group</a>.</p>
<p>Coordination Group participants <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> follow the
<a href="#coi">conflict of interest policy</a> by disclosing information to the
rest of the group.</p>
<p>There are no Good Standing requirements for Coordination Group
participation; regular participation in a relevant Coordination Group is one of
the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Guide/chair-roles">roles of a group Chair [MEM14]</a>.</p>
<h4>6.3.2 <a name="CGCreation" id="CGCreation">Coordination Group Creation and
Closure</a></h4>
<p>The Director creates or modifies a Coordination Group by sending the
<a href="#CGCharter">Coordination Group charter</a> to the Advisory Committee.
A Coordination Group <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> be created as part of an
<a href="#ActivityProposal">Activity Proposal</a> (for example to coordinate
other groups in the Activity or to draw up charters of future groups), or
during the life of an Activity when dependencies arise. A Coordination Group

<h2>7 <a name="Reports" id="Reports">W3C Technical Report Development
Process</a></h2>
<p>The W3C technical report development process is the set of steps and
requirements followed by W3C <a href="#GroupsWG">Working Groups</a> to
standardize Web technology. The processes followed by a Working Group to manage
specifications and guidelines -- called technical reports in this section --
include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#rec-advance">Advancing a technical report</a> from early draft to
mature deliverable ("Recommendation"); this is called the <a id="Recs" name="Recs">W3C Recommendation Track</a>;</li>

<li><a href="#rec-modify">Modifying a W3C Recommendation</a>;</li>
<li><a href="#rec-rescind">Rescinding a Recommendation</a> no longer endorsed

</ul>
<p>The W3C technical report development process is designed to maximize
<a href="#def-Consensus" rel="glossary" title="Definition of Consensus"><span class="dfn-instance">consensus</span></a> about
the content of a technical report, to ensure high technical and editorial
quality, to promote consistency among specifications, and to earn endorsement
by W3C and the broader community. See also the licensing goals for W3C
Recommendations in <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy#sec-Licensing">section 2</a> of the

<h3>7.2 <a name="transition-reqs" id="transition-reqs">General Requirements for
Advancement on the Recommendation Track</a></h3>
<p>In preparation for advancement to Candidate Recommendation or subsequent

<ol>
<li>Record the group's decision to request advancement.</li>
<li>Provide public documentation of all changes (both substantive and minor) to
the technical report since the previous step. A <a name="substantive-change" id="substantive-change">substantive change</a> (whether deletion, inclusion, or
other modification) is one where someone could reasonably expect that making
the change would invalidate an individual's review or implementation
experience. Other changes (e.g., clarifications, bug fixes, editorial repairs,
and minor error corrections) are <a name="minor-change" id="minor-change">minor
changes</a>.</li>
<li>Report which, if any, of the Working Group's requirements for this document
have changed since the previous step.</li>
<li>Report any changes in dependencies with other groups.</li>

<li><a href="#formal-address">Formally address</a> all issues raised about the
document since the previous step.</li>
<li>Report any <a href="#FormalObjection">Formal Objections</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following information is important to the decision to advance a

<ul>
<li>Documentation of all changes to the technical report (e.g., by providing

<h3>7.3 <a name="doc-reviews" id="doc-reviews">Reviews and Review
Responsibilities</a></h3>
<p>Experience shows that the following help build consensus around technical
reports:</p>
<ol>
<li>Frequent publication (see the <a href="#three-month-rule">Working Group
"Heartbeat" requirement</a>).</li>
<li>Early review, to find errors quickly and decrease the chances of diverging
technologies.</li>
<li>Wide review, including from other groups in and outside of W3C.</li>
</ol>
<p>A document receives review from the moment it is first published. Starting
with the First Public Working Draft until the start of a Last Call review, a

about a technical report and <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> do so in a
timely manner. When a Working Group requests to advance to Candidate
Recommendation or beyond, the Director expects positive documentation that
issues have been formally addressed (e.g., in an issues list that shows their
disposition).</p>
<p>The Director <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> formally address any
substantive issue raised by Advisory Committee representatives during Proposed
Recommendation, Proposed Edited Recommendation, and Proposed Rescinded
Recommendation review periods. The Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> communicate to the Director (usually through the Team
Contact) any substantive issues raised during Proposed Recommendation, Proposed
Edited Recommendation, and Proposed Rescinded Recommendation review periods by
parties other than Advisory Committee representatives.</p>
<p>Reviewers <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD NOT</span> send substantive technical
reviews late on the Recommendation track. Reviewers <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD NOT</span> expect that a Working Group will readily make
<a href="#substantive-change">substantive changes</a> to a mature document. The
more evidence a Working Group can show of wide review, the less weight
substantive comments will carry when provided late on the Recommendation Track.
Worthy ideas <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD BE</span> recorded even when not
incorporated into a mature document.</p>
<p>The Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be able to show evidence
of having attempted to respond to and satisfy reviewers. Reviewers <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> register a <a href="#FormalObjection">Formal Objection</a>
any time they are dissatisfied with how a Working Group has handled an
issue.</p>
<p>A Working Group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> negotiate review
schedules with other groups expected to review a document, including relevant
<a href="#Liaisons">liaisons</a>.</p>
<p>There are two formal review periods with fixed durations when advancing to
Recommendation: after a Last Call announcement and after a Call for Review of a
Proposed Recommendation. Out of consideration for the Working Group, reviewers
<span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> send their comments early in a review
period. A Working Group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD NOT</span> start a new
review before the scheduled end of an ongoing review (e.g., do not start a new
Last Call review before the scheduled end of an ongoing Last Call review).</p>
<p>Ordinarily, reviewers <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD NOT</span> raise
substantive technical issues about a technical report after the end of a Last
Call review period. However, this does occur, and as stated above, a Working
Group's requirement to formally address those issues extends until the start of
a Proposed Recommendation review period. However, to allow the Working Group to
make progress on a technical report, the Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> decline to make substantive changes to address issues
raised between the end of a Last Call review period and publication of a
Recommendation. A reviewer <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> register a <a href="#FormalObjection">Formal Objection</a>.</p>
<p>Advisory Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD NOT</span>
(but <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>) raise new substantive technical issues
during a Proposed Recommendation review period. The Director <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> respond to the reviewer after the close of the Proposed
Recommendation review period. <strong>Note:</strong> It may be necessary to
<a href="#confidentiality-change">change confidentiality level</a> when
conveying issues raised by Advisory Committee representatives to the Working
Group.</p>
<p>During review by the Members, the Working Group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> also <a href="#formal-address">formally address</a>
informed and relevant issues raised outside the Advisory Committee (e.g., by
the public or another W3C Working Group), and report them to the Director in a
timely fashion.</p>
<p>When a Working Group receives a substantive issue after the end of Proposed
Recommendation review period, the Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> respond to the reviewer but <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> decline to <a href="#formal-address">formally address</a>
the issue. In this case, the Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
consider the issue as part of tracking <a href="#errata">errata</a>.</p>
<h3>7.4 <a name="rec-advance" id="rec-advance">Advancing a Technical Report to
Recommendation</a></h3>
<p>W3C follows these steps when advancing a technical report to
Recommendation.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#first-wd">Publication of the First Public Working Draft</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#last-call">Last Call announcement</a></li>
<li><a href="#cfi">Call for Implementations</a>. <strong>Note:</strong> The
Director <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> permit the Working Group to skip this
step if the entrance criteria for the next step have already been
satisfied.</li>
<li><a href="#cfr">Call for Review of a Proposed Recommendation</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#rec-publication">Publication as a Recommendation</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In general, Working Groups embark on this journey with the intent of
publishing one or more Recommendations. However, W3C <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> <a href="#tr-end">end work on a technical report</a> at
any time, or <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> require a Working Group to
conduct <a href="#return-to-wg">further work</a>, possibly repeating one or
more steps.</p>
<p>Between publication of the First Public Working Draft and Last Call
announcement, a Working Group publishes revisions that generally include
substantive changes. Between any two steps after a Last Call announcement, the
Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> publish a new draft of the
technical report at the same maturity level provided there are no <a href="#substantive-change">substantive changes</a> since the earlier step.</p>
<p>The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> notify the <a href="#AC">Advisory
Committee</a> and other W3C groups of a revision to a Candidate Recommendation
or Proposed Recommendation.</p>
<p>These steps of the technical report development process can take
considerable time, so participants are encouraged to read the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/05/rec-tips">tips on getting to Recommendation
faster</a> [<a href="#ref-rec-tips">PUB27</a>].</p>
<p>Refer to <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/Transitions">"How to Organize a Recommendation
Track Transition"</a> in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Guide/">Member
guide</a> for practical information about preparing for the reviews and
announcements of the various steps.</p>
<h4>7.4.1 <a name="first-wd" id="first-wd">First Public Working Draft</a></h4>
<p>Document maturity level: <a href="#RecsWD">Working Draft</a>.</p>
<p>Announcement: The Director <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> announce the
first Working Draft publication to other W3C groups and to the public.</p>
<p>Purpose: The publication of the First Public Working Draft is a signal to
the community to begin reviewing the document. See <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-exclusion-with">section 4.1 of
the W3C Patent Policy</a> [<a href="#ref-patentpolicy">PUB33</a>] for
information about the policy implications of the First Public Working
Draft.</p>
<p>Entrance criteria: The Chair <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> record the
group's decision to request advancement. Since this is the first time that a
document with this short name appears in the Technical Reports index, Director
approval is <span class="rfc2119">REQUIRED</span> for the transition.</p>
<p>Ongoing work: After publication of the First Public Working Draft, the
Working Group generally revises the technical report (see the <a href="#three-month-rule">Working Group "Heartbeat" Requirement</a>) in accordance
with its charter.</p>
<p>In order to make Working Drafts available to a wide audience early in their
development, the requirements for publication of a Working Draft are limited to
an agreement by a chartered Working Group to publish the technical report and
satisfaction of the Team's <a href="http://www.w3.org/Guide/pubrules">Publication Rules</a> [<a href="#ref-pubrules">PUB31</a>]. Consensus is not a prerequisite for approval to
publish; the Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> request publication
of a Working Draft even if it is unstable and does not meet all Working Group
requirements.</p>
<p>Working Groups <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> encourage early and wide
review of the technical report, within and outside of W3C, especially from
other Working Groups with dependencies on the technical report. Advisory
Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> encourage review
within their organizations as early as First Public Working Draft, i.e., before
a <a href="#last-call">Last Call announcement</a> and <em>well before</em> a
<a href="#cfr">Call for Review of a Proposed Recommendation</a>.</p>
<p>The Working Group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> be responsive to and
facilitate ongoing review by addressing issues in a timely manner and clearly
indicating changes between drafts (e.g., by providing "diffs" and summaries of
<a href="#substantive-change">substantive changes</a>).</p>
<p>Possible next steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forward: <a href="#last-call">Last Call announcement</a>, generally done
after a series of Working Drafts.</li>
<li>Otherwise: <a href="#tr-end">end work</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>7.4.2 <a name="last-call" id="last-call">Last Call Announcement</a></h4>
<p>Document maturity level: <a href="#RecsWD">Working Draft</a>.</p>
<p>Announcement: The Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> announce
the Last Call to other W3C groups and to the public. A Last Call announcement
<span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>:</p>
<ol>
<li>specify the deadline for review comments;</li>
<li>identify known dependencies and solicit review from all dependent Working
Groups;</li>
<li>solicit public review.</li>
</ol>
<p>Purpose: A Working Group's Last Call announcement is a signal that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Working Group believes that it has satisfied its relevant technical
requirements (e.g., of the charter or requirements document) in the Working
Draft;</li>
<li>the Working Group believes that it has satisfied significant dependencies
with other groups;</li>
<li>other groups <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> review the document to
confirm that these dependencies have been satisfied.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, a Last Call announcement is also a signal that the Working Group
is planning to advance the technical report to later maturity levels.</p>
<p>A Working Group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> work with other groups
prior to a Last Call announcement to reduce the risk of surprise at Last
Call.</p>
<p>Ideally, after a Last Call announcement, a Working Group receives only
indications of support for the document, with no proposals for substantive
change. In practice, Last Call announcements generate comments that sometimes
result in substantive changes to a document. A Working Group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD NOT</span> assume that it has finished its work by virtue of
issuing a Last Call announcement.</p>
<p>Entrance criteria: Before announcing a Last Call, the Working Group
<span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> do all of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Record the group's decision to request advancement.</li>
<li>Fulfill the relevant requirements of the Working Group charter and those of
any accompanying requirements documents, or report which relevant requirements
have not been fulfilled.</li>
<li>Indicate which dependencies with other groups the Working Group believes it
has satisfied, and report which dependencies have not been satisfied.</li>
</ol>
<p>Duration of the review: The announcement begins a review period that
<span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> last at least <span class="time-interval">three weeks</span> but <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> last
longer if the technical report is complex or has significant external
dependencies.</p>
<p>Ongoing work: During the review period, the Working Group solicits and
responds to comments from the Team, the Members, other W3C groups, and the
public.</p>
<p>It is important to ensure the proper integration of a technical report in
the international community. Starting at this step in the Recommendation
process, the technical report <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> include a
statement about how the technology relates to existing international standards
and to related work outside of W3C.</p>
<p>Possible next steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forward: <a href="#cfi">Call for Implementations</a> or <a href="#cfr">Call
for Review of a Proposed Recommendation</a></li>
<li>Otherwise: <a href="#return-to-wg">return to Working Group</a> or <a href="#tr-end">end work</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>7.4.3 <a name="cfi" id="cfi">Call for Implementations</a></h4>
<p>Document maturity level: <a href="#RecsCR">Candidate Recommendation</a>.</p>
<p>Announcement: The Director <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> announce the
Call for Implementations to the <a href="#AC">Advisory Committee</a>.</p>
<p>Purpose: At this step, W3C believes the technical report is stable and
appropriate for implementation. The technical report <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> still change based on implementation experience.</p>
<p>Entrance criteria: The Director calls for implementation when satisfied that
the Working Group has fulfilled the <a href="#transition-reqs">general
requirements for advancement</a>.</p>
<p>The Working Group is <span class="rfc2119">NOT REQUIRED</span> to show that
a technical report has two independent and interoperable implementations as
part of a request to the Director to announce a Call for Implementations.
However, the Working Group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> include a report
of present and expected implementations as part of the request.</p>
<p>In the Call for Implementations, the Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> identify specific features of the technical report as
being "<a name="at-risk-feature" id="at-risk-feature">features at risk</a>."
General statements such as "We plan to remove any unimplemented feature" are
not acceptable; the Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> precisely
identify any features at risk. Thus, in response to a Call for Implementations,
reviewers can indicate whether they would register a <a href="#FormalObjection">Formal Objection</a> to the decision to remove the
identified features.</p>
<p>After gathering implementation experience, the Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> remove features from the technical report that were
identified as being "at risk" and request that the Director <a href="#cfr">Call
for Review of a Proposed Recommendation</a>. If the Working Group makes other
<a href="#substantive-change">substantive changes</a> to the technical report,
the Director <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> return it to the Working Group
for <a href="#return-to-wg">further work</a>.</p>
<p>The request to the Director to advance a technical report to Candidate
Recommendation <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> indicate whether the Working
Group expects to satisfy any Proposed Recommendation entrance criteria beyond
the default requirements (described below).</p>
<p>Advisory Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> <a href="#ACAppeal">appeal</a> the decision to advance the technical report.</p>
<p>Duration of the implementation period: The announcement <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> indicate a minimal duration, before which the Working
Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> request a <a href="#cfr">Call for
Review of a Proposed Recommendation</a>; this minimal duration is designed to
allow time for comment. The announcement <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span>
also include the Working Group's estimate of the time expected to gather
sufficient implementation data.</p>
<p>Possible next steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forward: <a href="#cfr">Call for Review of a Proposed
Recommendation</a></li>
<li>Otherwise: <a href="#return-to-wg">return to Working Group</a> or <a href="#tr-end">end work</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>7.4.4 <a name="cfr" id="cfr">Call for Review of a Proposed
Recommendation</a></h4>
<p>Document maturity level: <a href="#RecsPR">Proposed Recommendation</a>.</p>
<p>Announcement: The Director <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> announce the
Call for Review to the <a href="#AC">Advisory Committee</a>.</p>
<p>Purpose: At this step, W3C seeks endorsement of the stable technical report.
The outcome of this review is taken as an indication of the organization's
support for the technical report.</p>
<p>Entrance criteria: The Director calls for review when satisfied that the
Working Group has:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fulfilled the <a href="#transition-reqs">general requirements for
advancement</a>;</li>
<li>Shown that each feature of the technical report has been implemented.
Preferably, the Working Group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> be able to
demonstrate two interoperable implementations of each feature. If the Director
believes that immediate Advisory Committee review is critical to the success of
a technical report, the Director <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> accept to
Call for Review of a Proposed Recommendation even without adequate
implementation experience;</li>
<li>Satisfied any other announced entrance criteria (e.g., any included in the
request to advance to Candidate Recommendation, or announced at Last Call if
the Working Group does not intend to issue a Call for Implementations).</li>
</ol>
<p>Advisory Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> <a href="#ACAppeal">appeal</a> the decision to advance the technical report.</p>
<p>Duration of the review: The announcement begins a review period that
<span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> last at least <span class="time-interval">four weeks</span>.</p>
<p>Ongoing work: During the review period, the Working Group requests
endorsement and support from Members (e.g., testimonials as part of a press
release).</p>
<p>Possible next steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forward: Publication as a <a href="#rec-publication">W3C
Recommendation</a></li>
<li>Otherwise: <a href="#cfi">Call for Implementations</a> if there are
questions related to implementation, <a href="#return-to-wg">return to Working
Group</a> or <a href="#tr-end">end work</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>7.4.5 <a name="rec-publication" id="rec-publication">Publication of a W3C
Recommendation</a></h4>
<p>Document maturity level: <a href="#RecsW3C">Recommendation</a>.</p>
<p>Announcement: The Director <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> announce the
publication of a W3C Recommendation to the <a href="#AC">Advisory
Committee</a>.</p>
<p>Purpose: W3C publishes Recommendations when it believes that the ideas in
the technical report are appropriate for widespread deployment and that they
promote <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/#mission">W3C's mission</a>.</p>
<p>Entrance criteria: The Director publishes a W3C Recommendation when
satisfied that there is significant support for the technical report from the
Advisory Committee, the Team, W3C Working Groups, and the public. The decision
to advance a document to Recommendation is a <a href="#def-w3c-decision" rel="glossary" title="Definition of W3C decision"><span class="dfn-instance">W3C
decision</span></a>.</p>
<p>If there was any <a href="#def-Dissent" rel="glossary" title="Definition of Dissent"><span class="dfn-instance">dissent</span></a> during
the Member review, Advisory Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> <a href="#ACAppeal">appeal</a> the decision to publish the
Recommendation.</p>
<p>Possible next steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>End state: A technical report <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> remain a
Recommendation indefinitely</li>
<li>Otherwise: <a href="#rec-modify">Modification of a Recommendation</a> or
<a href="#rec-rescind">Rescinding a Recommendation</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The Director <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> submit a W3C Recommendation to
another standards body for adoption and formal approval by that body.</p>
<h4>7.4.6 <a name="return-to-wg" id="return-to-wg">Returning a Document to a
Working Group for Further Work</a></h4>
<p>A technical report is returned to a Working Group for further work in either
of the following situations:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Working Group makes <a href="#substantive-change">substantive
changes</a> to the technical report at any time after a <a href="#last-call">Last Call announcement</a> and prior to <a href="#rec-publication">Publication as a Recommendation</a>, <strong>except</strong>
when the changes involve the removal of <a href="#at-risk-feature">features at
risk</a> identified in a <a href="#cfi">Call for Implementations</a>. In the
case of substantive changes, the Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> republish the technical report as a Working Draft.</li>
<li>The Director requires the Working Group to address important issues raised
during a review or as the result of implementation experience. In this case,
Director <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> request that the Working Group
republish the technical report as a Working Draft, even if the Working Group
has not made <a href="#substantive-change">substantive changes</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Director <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> inform the <a href="#AC">Advisory Committee</a> and group Chairs when a technical report has been
returned to a Working Group for further work.</p>
<p>After republication as a Working Draft, the next forward step available to
the Working Group is a <a href="#last-call">Last Call announcement</a>. The
Last Call announcement <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> occur at the same time
as the publication of the Working Draft.</p>
<p>The Director <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> ask the Working Group to
republish a technical report as a Candidate Recommendation. At the same time as
publication, the Director issues a <a href="#cfi">Call for
Implementations</a>.</p>
<h3>7.5 <a name="tr-end" id="tr-end">Ending Work on a Technical Report</a></h3>
<p>Work on a technical report <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> cease at any
time. When a Working Group completes its work on a technical report, it
publishes it either as a Recommendation or a Working Group Note. For example, a
Working Group might publish several Working Drafts of a requirements document,
and then indicate that it no longer plans to work on the requirements document
by publishing a Working Group Note.</p>
<p>Work <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> also cease because W3C determines that
it cannot productively carry the work any further. For instance, the Director
might <a href="#GeneralTermination">close a Working Group</a>, the participants
might lose interest in a technical report, or the ideas might be subsumed by
another technical report. If W3C decides to discontinue work on a technical
report before completion, the technical report <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> be published as a Working Group Note.</p>
<p>Possible next steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>End state: A technical report <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> remain a
Working Group Note indefinitely</li>
<li>Otherwise: A Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> resume work on
the technical report as a Working Draft</li>
</ul>
<h3>7.6 <a name="rec-modify" id="rec-modify">Modifying a W3C
Recommendation</a></h3>
<p>W3C makes every effort to maintain its Recommendations (e.g., by tracking
errata, providing test-bed applications, and helping to create test suites) and
to encourage widespread implementation. The following sections discuss the
management of errors and the process for making normative changes to a
Recommendation.</p>
<h4>7.6.1 <a name="errata" id="errata">Errata Management</a></h4>
<p>Tracking errors is an important part of a Working Group's ongoing care of a
Recommendation; for this reason, the scope of a Working Group charter generally
allows time for work after publication of a Recommendation. In this Process
Document, the term "erratum" (plural "errata") refers to any class of mistake,
from mere editorial to a serious error that may affect the conformance with the
Recommendation by software or content (e.g., content validity).
<strong>Note:</strong> Before a document becomes a Recommendation, the W3C
Process focuses on <a href="#substantive-change">substantive changes</a> (those
related to prior reviews). After a document has been published as
Recommendation, the W3C Process focuses on those changes to a technical report
that might affect the conformance of content or deployed software.</p>
<p>Working Groups <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> track errata on an "errata
page." An errata page is a list of enumerated errors, possibly accompanied by
corrections. Each Recommendation links to an errata page; see the Team's
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Guide/pubrules">Publication Rules</a>.</p>
<p>A correction is first "proposed" by the Working Group. A correction becomes
normative -- of equal status as the text in the published Recommendation --
through one of the processes described below. An errata page <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> include both proposed and normative corrections. The
Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> clearly identify which
corrections are proposed and which are normative.</p>
<p>A Working Group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> keep their errata pages
up-to-date, as errors are reported by readers and implementers. A Working Group
<span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> report errata page changes to interested
parties, notably when corrections are proposed or become normative, according
to the Team's requirements. For instance, the Team might set up a mailing list
per Recommendation where a Working Group reports changes to an errata page.</p>
<h4>7.6.2 <a name="correction-classes" id="correction-classes">Classes of
Changes to a Recommendation</a></h4>
<p>This document distinguishes the following classes of changes to a
Recommendation.</p>
<dl>
<dt>1. No changes to text content</dt>
<dd>These changes include fixing broken links or invalid markup.</dd>
<dt>2. Corrections that do not affect conformance</dt>
<dd>Editorial changes or clarifications that do not change the technical
content of the specification.</dd>
<dt>3. Corrections that <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> affect conformance,
but add no new features</dt>
<dd>These changes <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> affect conformance to the
Recommendation. A change that affects conformance is one that:
<ol>
<li>turns conforming data, processors, or other conforming agents into
non-conforming agents, or</li>
<li>turns non-conforming agents into conforming ones, or</li>
<li>clears up an ambiguity or under-specified part of the specification in such
a way that an agent whose conformance was once unclear becomes clearly
conforming or non-conforming.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>4. New features</dt>
</dl>
<p>The first two classes of change require no technical review of the proposed
changes, although a Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> issue a Call
for Review. The modified Recommendation is published according to the Team's
requirements, including <a href="http://www.w3.org/Guide/pubrules">Publication
Rules</a> [<a href="#ref-pubrules">PUB31</a>].</p>
<p>For the third class of change, W3C requires:</p>
<ol>
<li>Review by the community to ensure the technical soundness of proposed
corrections.</li>
<li>Timely publication of the edited Recommendation, with corrections
incorporated.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the third class of change, the Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Request that the Director issue a <a href="#cfr-edited">Call for Review of
an Edited Recommendation</a>, or</li>
<li>Issue a <a href="#cfr-corrections">Call for Review of Proposed
Corrections</a> that have not been incorporated into an edited draft (e.g.,
those listed on an errata page). After this review, the Director <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> announce that the proposed corrections are normative.</li>
</ol>
<p>While the second approach is designed so that a Working Group can establish
normative corrections quickly, it does not obviate the need to incorporate
changes into an edited version of the Recommendation. In particular, when
corrections are numerous or complex, integrating them into a single document is
important for interoperability; readers might otherwise interpret the
corrections differently.</p>
<p>For the fourth class of change (new features), W3C <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> follow the full process of <a href="#rec-advance">advancing a technical report to Recommendation</a>.</p>
<h4>7.6.3 <a name="cfr-edited" id="cfr-edited">Call for Review of an Edited
Recommendation</a></h4>
<p>Document maturity level: <a href="#ProposedEditedRec">Proposed Edited
Recommendation</a>.</p>
<p>Announcement: The Director <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> announce the

indicate that this is a proposal to edit a Recommendation and <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>:</p>
<ol>
<li>specify the deadline for review comments;</li>
<li>identify known dependencies and solicit review from all dependent Working
Groups;</li>
<li>solicit public review.</li>
</ol>
<p>Purpose: At this step, W3C seeks confirmation of proposed corrections to a
Recommendation.</p>
<p>Entrance criteria: The Director calls for review when satisfied that, with
respect to changes to the document, the Working Group has fulfilled the same
entrance criteria as for a <a href="#cfr">Call for Review of a Proposed
Recommendation</a> (e.g., the Working Group can show implementation experience
that supports the changes). In the request to advance to this status, the
Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> report any substantive issues
about the technical report that have not been resolved.</p>
<p>Advisory Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> <a href="#ACAppeal">appeal</a> the decision to advance the technical report.</p>
<p>Duration of the review: The announcement begins a formal Advisory Committee
review period that <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> last at least <span class="time-interval">four weeks</span>.</p>
<p>Ongoing work: During the review period, the Working Group solicits and
responds to comments from the Team, the Members, other W3C groups, and the
public.</p>
<p>Possible next steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forward: <a href="#rec-publication">Publication of a W3C
Recommendation</a></li>
<li>Otherwise, the Recommendation remains unchanged and two steps are possible:
<a href="#return-to-wg">return to Working Group</a> or <a href="#tr-end">end

</ul>
<h4>7.6.4 <a name="cfr-corrections" id="cfr-corrections">Call for Review of
Proposed Corrections</a></h4>
<p>Document maturity level: A Recommendation, plus a list of proposed
corrections. The Working Group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> also include
a detailed description of how the Working Group plans to change the text of the
Recommendation for each proposed correction.</p>
<p>Announcement: The Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> announce
the Call for Review to other W3C groups, the public, and the <a href="#AC">Advisory Committee</a>. This is not a formal <a href="#ACReview">Advisory
Committee review</a>. However, the announcement <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> clearly indicate that this is a proposal to make
normative corrections to the Recommendation and <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>:</p>
<ol>
<li>specify the deadline for review comments;</li>

</ol>
<p>Purpose: At this step, W3C seeks confirmation of proposed corrections to a

<p>Entrance criteria: The Working Group calls for review when, with respect to
changes to the document, the group has fulfilled the same entrance criteria as
for a <a href="#cfr">Call for Review of a Proposed Recommendation</a>.</p>
<p>Duration of the review: The announcement begins a review period that
<span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> last at least <span class="time-interval">four weeks</span>.</p>
<p>Ongoing work: Same as for a <a href="#cfr-edited">Proposed Edited
Recommendation</a>.</p>
<p>If there are no <a href="#FormalObjection">Formal Objections</a> to the
proposed corrections, W3C considers them normative. The Working Group
<span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> report Formal Objections to the Director, who
assesses whether there is sufficient consensus to declare the proposed
corrections to be normative.</p>
<p>Possible next steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forward: <a href="#rec-publication">Publication of a W3C
Recommendation</a>. In order for the corrections to remain normative, the
Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> incorporate them into an edited
Recommendation. The Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> publish the
revised Recommendation within <span class="time-interval">six months</span>
after the end of the review or secure an extension from the Director. Prior to
publication, if the Working Group makes further changes to the technical report
that affect conformance, the Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
request a <a href="#cfr-edited">Call for Review of an Edited
Recommendation</a>.</li>
<li>Otherwise: The Recommendation remains unchanged and two steps are possible:

</ul>
<h3>7.7 <a name="rec-rescind" id="rec-rescind">Rescinding a W3C
Recommendation</a></h3>
<p>At times, W3C <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> rescind an entire
Recommendation, for instance when W3C learns of significant errors in the
Recommendation, when the Recommendation becomes outdated, or if W3C discovers
burdensome patent claims that affect implementers; see the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy">W3C Patent Policy</a> [<a href="#ref-patentpolicy">PUB33</a>] and in particular <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy#sec-Requirements">section 5</a>

<h3>7.8 <a name="DocumentsGeneral" id="DocumentsGeneral">General Information
about Technical Reports</a></h3>
<p>Every document published as part of the technical report development process
<span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be a public document. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/">index of W3C technical reports</a> [<a href="#ref-doc-list">PUB11</a>] is available at the W3C Web site. W3C will make
every effort to make archival documents indefinitely available at their

<p>Every document published as part of the technical report development process
<span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> clearly indicate its <a href="#maturity-levels">maturity level</a>.</p>
<p>Every technical report published as part of the technical report development
process is edited by one or more editors appointed by a Working Group Chair. It
is the responsibility of these editors to ensure that the decisions of the
group are correctly reflected in subsequent drafts of the technical report. An
editor for the TAG or Advisory Board who is not an elected or appointed
participant in that group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> fulfill the same
participation requirements for that group, as a Member representative, Team
representative, or Invited Expert. All other W3C editors <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be participants in the group responsible for the
document(s) they are editing. Note that an editor is <span class="rfc2119">NOT
REQUIRED</span> to be a Team representative.</p>
<p>The Team is <span class="rfc2119">NOT REQUIRED</span> to publish a technical
report that does not conform to the Team's <a href="http://www.w3.org/Guide/pubrules">Publication Rules</a> (e.g., for <a name="DocumentName" id="DocumentName">naming</a>, style, and <a name="document-copyright" id="document-copyright">copyright requirements</a>). These
rules are subject to change. The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> inform
group Chairs and the Advisory Board of any changes.</p>
<p>The Team reserves the right to reformat technical reports at any time so as
to conform to changes in W3C practice (e.g., changes to technical report styles
or the <a href="#DocumentStatus">document status section</a>).</p>
<p>The primary language for W3C technical reports is English. W3C encourages
the translation of its technical reports. <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation/">Information about translations of
W3C technical reports</a> [<a href="#ref-translations">PUB18</a>] is available

<p>Each technical report <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> include a section
about the status of the document. The status section <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> explain why W3C has published the technical report,
expectations about next steps, who developed it, where to send comments about
it, whether implementation experience is being sought, any significant changes
from the previous version, why work on the technical report has ceased or been

</ul>
<h4>8.1.1 <a name="ACReviewStart" id="ACReviewStart">Start of a Review
Period</a></h4>
<p>Each Advisory Committee review period begins with a Call for Review from the
Team to the Advisory Committee. The <a name="reviewform" id="reviewform">review
form</a> describes the proposal, raises attention to deadlines, estimates when
the decision will be available, and includes other practical information. Each
Member organization <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> send one review, which
<span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be returned by its Advisory Committee
representative.</p>
<p>The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> provide two channels for Advisory

<ol>
<li>an archived <a href="#Team-only">Team-only</a> channel; this is the default

<p>A Member organization <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> modify its review
during a review period (e.g., in light of comments from other Members).</p>
<h4>8.1.2 <a name="ACReviewAfter" id="ACReviewAfter">After the Review

<p>After the review period, the Director <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
announce to the Advisory Committee the level of support for the proposal
(<a href="#def-Consensus" rel="glossary" title="Definition of Consensus"><span class="dfn-instance">consensus</span></a> or
<a href="#def-Dissent" rel="glossary" title="Definition of Dissent"><span class="dfn-instance">dissent</span></a>). The

<li>The proposal is rejected.</li>
</ol>
<p>This document does not specify time intervals between the end of an Advisory
Committee review period and the <a href="#def-w3c-decision" rel="glossary" title="Definition of W3C decision"><span class="dfn-instance">W3C

sufficient time to consider comments gathered during the review. The Advisory
Committee <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD NOT</span> expect an announcement sooner
than <span class="time-interval">two weeks</span> after the end of a Proposed

<h3>8.2 <a name="ACAppeal" id="ACAppeal">Appeal by Advisory Committee
Representatives</a></h3>
<p>Advisory Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> appeal
certain decisions, though appeals are only expected to occur in extraordinary
circumstances.</p>
<p>When Advisory Committee review immediately precedes a decision, Advisory
Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> only appeal when
there is <a href="#def-Dissent" rel="glossary" title="Definition of Dissent"><span class="dfn-instance">dissent</span></a>. These

</ul>
<p>In all cases, an appeal <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be initiated
within <span class="time-interval">three weeks</span> of the decision.</p>
<p>An Advisory Committee representative initiates an appeal by sending a
request to the Team (explained in detail in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Member/Intro">New Member Orientation</a>). The Team
<span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> announce the appeal process to the Advisory
Committee and provide an address for comments from Advisory Committee
representatives. The archive of these comments <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be Member-visible. If, within <span class="time-interval">one week</span> of the Team's announcement, 5% or more of the
Advisory Committee support the appeal request, the Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> organize an appeal vote asking the Advisory Committee to
approve or reject the decision. <!-- Voting procedure to be determined --></p>
<h3>8.3 <a name="ACVotes" id="ACVotes">Advisory Committee Votes</a></h3>
<p>The Advisory Committee votes in <a href="#AB-TAG-elections">elections for

group of <a href="#MemberRelated">related Members</a> has one vote. In the case
of <a href="#AB-TAG-elections">Advisory Board and TAG elections</a>, "one vote"
means "one vote per available seat".</p>

<h2>9 <a name="GAEvents" id="GAEvents">Workshops and Symposia</a></h2>
<p>The Team organizes <a name="EventsW" id="EventsW">Workshops</a> and <a name="EventsS" id="EventsS">Symposia</a> to promote early involvement in the
development of W3C Activities from Members and the public.</p>
<p>The goal of a Workshop is usually either to convene experts and other
interested parties for an exchange of ideas about a technology or policy, or to
address the pressing concerns of W3C Members. Organizers of the first type of
Workshop <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> solicit position papers for the
Workshop program and <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> use those papers to
choose attendees and/or presenters.</p>
<p>The goal of a Symposium is usually to educate interested parties about a
particular subject.</p>
<p>The Call for Participation in a Workshop or Symposium <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> indicate participation requirements or limits, and
expected deliverables (e.g., reports and minutes). Organization of an event
does not guarantee further investment by W3C in a particular topic, but
<span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> lead to proposals for new Activities or
groups.</p>
<p>Workshops and Symposia generally last one to three days. If a Workshop is
being organized to address the pressing concerns of Members, the Team
<span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> issue the Call for Participation no later
than <span class="time-interval">six weeks</span> prior to the Workshop's
scheduled start date. For other Workshops and Symposia, the Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> issue a Call for Participation no later than <span class="time-interval">eight weeks</span> prior to the meeting's scheduled start date.
This helps ensure that speakers and authors have adequate time to prepare
position papers and talks.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In general, W3C does not organize <a name="EventsC" id="EventsC">conferences</a>. Currently, W3C presents its work to the public at
the annual World Wide Web Conference, which is coordinated by the <a href="http://www.iw3c2.org/">International World Wide Web Conference Committee</a>

<h2>10 <a name="Liaisons" id="Liaisons">Liaisons</a></h2>
<p>W3C uses the term "liaison" to refer to coordination of activities with a
variety of organizations, through a number of mechanisms ranging from very
informal (e.g., an individual from another organization participates in a W3C
Working Group, or just follows its work) to mutual membership, to even more
formal agreements. Liaisons are not meant to substitute for W3C membership.</p>
<p>All liaisons <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be coordinated by the Team
due to requirements for public communication; patent, copyright, and other IPR
policies; confidentiality agreements; and mutual membership agreements.</p>
<p>The W3C Director <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> negotiate and sign a
<a name="mou" id="mou">Memorandum of Understanding (<acronym>MoU</acronym>)</a>
with another organization. Before signing the MoU, the Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> inform the Advisory Committee of the intent to sign and
make the MoU available for Advisory Committee review; the Advisory Committee
<span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> <a href="#ACAppeal">appeal</a>. Once approved,

<h2>11 <a name="Submission" id="Submission">Member Submission Process</a></h2>
<p>The Member Submission process allows Members to propose technology or other
ideas for consideration by the Team. After review, the Team <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> publish the material at the W3C Web site. The formal
process affords Members a record of their contribution and gives them a
mechanism for disclosing the details of the transaction with the Team
(including IPR claims). The Team also publishes review comments on the
Submitted materials for W3C Members, the public, and the media.</p>
<p>A <a name="MemberSubmission" id="MemberSubmission">Member Submission</a>
consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>One or more documents developed outside of the W3C process, and</li>
<li>Information about the documents, provided by the Submitter.</li>
</ul>
<p>One or more Members (called the "Submitter(s)") <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> participate in a Member Submission. Only W3C Members
<span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> be listed as Submitter(s).</p>
<p>The Submission process consists of the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>One of the Submitter(s) sends a request to the Team to acknowledge the
Submission request. The Team and Submitter(s) communicate to ensure that the
Member Submission is complete.</li>
<li>After Team review, the Director <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> either
acknowledge or reject the Submission request.
<ul>
<li>If <a href="#SubmissionYes">acknowledged</a>, the Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> publish the Member Submission at the public W3C Web site,
in addition to Team comments about the Member Submission.</li>
<li>If <a href="#SubmissionNo">rejected</a>, the Submitter(s) <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> appeal to either the <a href="#TAG">TAG</a> or the
<a href="#AB">Advisory Board</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> To avoid confusion about the Member Submission
process, please note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Documents in a Member Submission are developed outside of W3C. These
documents are <strong>not</strong> part of the <a href="#Reports">technical
report development process</a> (and therefore are not included in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/">index of W3C technical reports</a>). Members wishing to
have documents developed outside of W3C published by W3C <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> follow the Member Submission process.</li>
<li>The Submission process is <strong>not</strong> a means by which Members ask
for "ratification" of these documents as <a href="#RecsW3C">W3C
Recommendations</a>.</li>
<li>There is no requirement or guarantee that technology which is part of an
acknowledged Submission request will receive further consideration by W3C
(e.g., by a W3C Working Group).</li>
</ul>
<p>Publication of a Member Submission by W3C does not imply endorsement by W3C,
including the W3C Team or Members. The acknowledgment of a Submission request
does not imply that any action will be taken by W3C. It merely records publicly
that the Submission request has been made by the Submitter. A Member Submission
published by W3C <span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> be referred to as "work
in progress" of the W3C.</p>
<p>The list of <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/">acknowledged Member
Submissions</a> [<a href="#ref-submission-list">PUB10</a>] is available at the
W3C Web site.</p>
<h3>11.1 <a name="SubmissionRights" id="SubmissionRights">Submitter Rights and
Obligations</a></h3>
<p>When more than one Member jointly participates in a Submission request, only
one Member formally sends in the request. That Member <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> copy each of the Advisory Committee representatives of
the other participating Members, and each of those Advisory Committee
representatives <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> confirm (by email to the
Team) their participation in the Submission request.</p>
<p>At any time prior to acknowledgment, any Submitter <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> withdraw support for a Submission request (described in
"<a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/submission">How to send a Submission
request</a>"). A Submission request is "withdrawn" when no Submitter(s) support
it. The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> make statements about
withdrawn Submission requests.</p>
<p>Prior to acknowledgment, the Submitter(s) <span class="rfc2119">MUST
NOT</span>, <strong>under any circumstances</strong>, refer to a document as
"submitted to the World Wide Web Consortium" or "under consideration by W3C" or
any similar phrase either in public or Member communication. The Submitter(s)
<span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> imply in public or Member communication
that W3C is working (with the Submitter(s)) on the material in the Member
Submission. The Submitter(s) <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> publish the
documents in the Member Submission prior to acknowledgment (without reference
to the Submission request).</p>
<p>After acknowledgment, the Submitter(s) <span class="rfc2119">MUST
NOT</span>, <strong>under any circumstances</strong>, imply W3C investment in
the Member Submission until, and unless, the material has been adopted as part
of a W3C <a href="#def-Activity" rel="glossary" title="Definition of Activity"><span class="dfn-instance">Activity</span></a>.</p>
<h4>11.1.1 <a name="SubmissionScope" id="SubmissionScope">Scope of Member
Submissions</a></h4>
<p>When a technology overlaps in scope with the work of a chartered Working
Group, Members <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> <a href="#group-participation">participate in the Working Group</a> and contribute the
technology to the group's process rather than seek publication through the
Member Submission process. The Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
incorporate the contributed technology into its deliverables. If the Working
Group does not incorporate the technology, it <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD
NOT</span> publish the contributed documents as Working Group Notes since
Working Group Notes represent group output, not input to the group.</p>
<p>On the other hand, while W3C is in the early stages of developing an
Activity Proposal or charter, Members <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> use
the Submission process to build consensus around concrete proposals for new
work.</p>
<p>Members <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD NOT</span> submit materials covering
topics well outside the scope of <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/#mission">W3C's mission</a> [<a href="#ref-mission">PUB15</a>].</p>
<h4>11.1.2 <a name="SubmissionReqs" id="SubmissionReqs">Information Required in
a Submission Request</a></h4>
<p>The Submitter(s) and any other authors of the submitted material
<span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> agree that, if the request is acknowledged,
the documents in the Member Submission will be subject to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-documents">W3C Document
License</a> [<a href="#ref-doc-license">PUB18</a>] and will include a reference
to it. The Submitter(s) <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> hold the copyright for
the documents in a Member Submission.</p>
<p>The request must satisfy the Member Submission licensing commitments of
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy#sec-submissions">section
3.3</a> of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy">W3C Patent
Policy</a> [<a href="#ref-patentpolicy">PUB33</a>].</p>
<p>The Submitter(s) <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> include the following
information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The list of all submitting Members.</li>
<li>Position statements from all submitting Members (gathered by the
Submitter). All position statements must appear in a separate document.</li>
<li>Complete electronic copies of any documents submitted for consideration
(e.g., a technical specification, a position paper, etc.) If the Submission
request is acknowledged, these documents will be published by W3C and therefore
must satisfy the Communication Team's <a href="http://www.w3.org/Guide/pubrules">Publication Rules</a> [<a href="#ref-pubrules">PUB31</a>]. Submitters may hold the copyright for the material
contained in these documents, but when published by W3C, these documents
<span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be subject to the provisions of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-documents">W3C Document
License</a> [<a href="#ref-doc-license">PUB18</a>].</li>
</ul>
<p>The request <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> also answer the following
questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>What proprietary technology is required to implement the areas addressed by
the request, and what terms are associated with its use? Again, many answers
are possible, but the specific answer will affect the Team's decision.</li>
<li>What resources, if any, does the Submitter intend to make available if the
W3C acknowledges the Submission request and takes action on it?</li>
<li>What action would the Submitter like W3C to take if the Submission request
is acknowledged?</li>
<li>What mechanisms are there to make changes to the specification being
submitted? This includes, but is not limited to, stating where change control
will reside if the request is acknowledged.</li>
</ul>
<p>For other administrative requirements related to Submission requests, see
"<a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/submission">How to send a Submission
request</a>" [<a href="#ref-member-sub">MEM8</a>].</p>
<h3>11.2 <a name="TeamSubmissionRights" id="TeamSubmissionRights">Team Rights
and Obligations</a></h3>
<p>Although they are not technical reports, the documents in a Member
Submission <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> fulfill the requirements
established by the Team, including the Team's <a href="http://www.w3.org/Guide/pubrules">Publication Rules</a>.</p>
<p>The Team sends a <a name="validation-notice" id="validation-notice">validation notice</a> to the Submitter(s) once the Team has
reviewed a Submission request and judged it complete and correct.</p>
<p>Prior to a decision to <a href="#SubmissionYes">acknowledge</a> or <a href="#SubmissionNo">reject</a> the request, the request is <a href="#Team-only">Team-only</a>, and the Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> hold
it in the strictest confidentiality. In particular, the Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> comment to the media about the Submission
request.</p>
<h3>11.3 <a name="SubmissionYes" id="SubmissionYes">Acknowledgment of a
Submission Request</a></h3>
<p>The Director <a href="#SubmissionYes">acknowledges</a> a Submission request
by sending an announcement to the Advisory Committee. Though the announcement
<span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> be made at any time, the Submitter(s) can
expect an announcement between <span class="time-interval">four to six
weeks</span> after the <a href="#validation-notice">validation notice</a>. The
Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> keep the Submitter(s) informed of when
an announcement is likely to be made.</p>
<p>Once a Submission request has been acknowledged, the Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publish the Member Submission.</li>
<li>Publish Team comments about the Submission request.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the Submitter(s) wishes to modify a document published as the result of
acknowledgment, the Submitter(s) <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> start the
Submission process from the beginning, even just to correct editorial
changes.</p>
<h3>11.4 <a name="SubmissionNo" id="SubmissionNo">Rejection of a Submission
Request</a></h3>
<p>The Director <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> reject a Submission request
for a variety of reasons, including any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ideas expressed in the request overlap in scope with the work of a
chartered Working Group, and acknowledgment might jeopardize the progress of
the group.</li>
<li>The IPR statement made by the Submitter(s) is inconsistent with the W3C's
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy">Patent Policy</a>
[<a href="#ref-patentpolicy">PUB33</a>], <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-documents">Document License</a>
[<a href="#ref-doc-license">PUB18</a>], or other IPR policies.</li>
<li>The ideas expressed in the request are poor, might harm the Web, or run
counter to <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/#mission">W3C's
mission</a>.</li>
<li>The ideas expressed in the request lie well outside the scope of W3C's
mission.</li>
</ul>
<p>In case of a rejection, the Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> inform
the Advisory Committee representative(s) of the Submitter(s). If requested by
the Submitter(s), the Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> provide rationale
to the Submitter(s) about the rejection. Other than to the Submitter(s), the
Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> make statements about why a
Submission request was rejected.</p>
<p>The Advisory Committee representative(s) of the Submitters(s) <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> appeal the rejection to the <a href="#TAG">TAG</a> if the
reasons are related to Web architecture, or to the <a href="#AB">Advisory
Board</a> if the request is rejected for other reasons. In this case the Team
<span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> make available its rationale for the
rejection to the appropriate body. The Team will establish a process for such
appeals that ensures the appropriate <a href="#confidentiality-levels">level of
confidentiality</a>.</p>

<p>The <a name="ProcessDoc" id="ProcessDoc">W3C Process Document</a> undergoes
similar consensus-building processes as technical reports, with the <a href="#AB">Advisory Board</a> acting as the sponsoring Working Group.</p>
<p>The Advisory Board initiates review of a Process Document as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Team sends a Call for Review to the Advisory Committee and other W3C

<li>After comments have been <a href="#formal-address">formally addressed</a>
and the document possibly modified, the Team seeks endorsement from the Members
by initiating an <a href="#ACReview">Advisory Committee review</a> of a

last at least <span class="time-interval">four weeks</span>.</li>
<li><a href="#ACReviewAfter">After the Advisory Committee review</a>, if there

to the Advisory Committee. If there was <a href="#def-Dissent" rel="glossary" title="Definition of Dissent"><span class="dfn-instance">dissent</span></a>,
Advisory Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> <a href="#ACAppeal">appeal</a> the decision.</li>
