<h2>1 <a id="Intro" name="Intro">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>The W3C Process Document describes the organizational structure of the W3C
and the processes related to the responsibilities and functions they exercise
to enable W3C to accomplish its mission. Much W3C work involves the
standardization of Web technology. <a href="#GAGeneral">Working Groups</a>
carry out this work by building consensus around technical reports that become
<a href="#RecsW3C">W3C Recommendations</a>. This document describes processes
for creating Recommendations, coordinating groups within W3C, and coordinating
W3C work with that of other organizations.</p>

<p>The Process Document formalizes the most important aspects of how W3C works
to achieve such goals as: quality results, consensus about the results,
responses to comments, fairness, and progress. Here is a general overview of
what goes into developing a W3C Recommendation.</p>

<ol>
<li>People generate interest in a particular topic (e.g., Web services). For
instance, Members express interest in the form of <a href="#Submission">Member
Submissions</a>, and the <a href="#Team">Team</a> monitors work inside and
outside of W3C for signs of interest. Also, W3C is likely to organize a <a href="#GAEvents">workshop</a> to bring people together to discuss topics that
interest the W3C community. This was the case, for example, with Web
services.</li>

<li>When there is enough interest in a topic (e.g., after a successful workshop
and/or discussion on an <a href="#ACCommunication">Advisory Committee mailing
list</a>), the Director announces the <a href="#ActivityDevelopment">development of a proposal for a new Activity</a> or
<a href="#WGCharterDevelopment">Working Group charter</a>, depending on the
breadth of the topic of interest. An <a href="#ActivityProposal">Activity
Proposal</a> describes the scope, duration, and other characteristics of the
intended work, and includes the charters of one or more <a href="#GAGeneral">Working Groups, Interest Groups, and possibly Coordination
Groups</a> to carry out the work. W3C Members <a href="#ActivityCreation">review each Activity Proposal</a> and the associated
Working Group charters. When there is support within W3C for investing
resources in the topic of interest, the Director approves the new Activity and
groups get down to work. For the Web Services Activity, the initial Activity
Proposal called for one Working Group to work on Web Services Architecture and
one to work on a language for Web Services Description. The Activity Proposal
also incorporated an existing Working Group (from another Activity) working on
XML Protocols.</li>

<li>There are four types of Working Group participants: the <a href="#GeneralChairs">Chair</a>, <a href="#member-rep">Member
representatives</a>, <a href="#invited-expert-wg">invited experts</a>, and <a href="#Team">Team representatives</a>. Team representatives both contribute to
the technical work and help ensure the group's proper integration with the rest
of W3C. The <a href="#WGCharter">Working Group charter</a> sets expectations
about each group's deliverables (e.g., <a href="#Reports">technical
reports</a>, test suites, and tutorials).</li>

<li>Working Groups generally create specifications and guidelines that undergo
cycles of revision and review as they <a href="#rec-advance">advance to W3C
Recommendation</a> status. The W3C process for producing these technical
reports includes significant review by the Members and public, and requirements
that the Working Group be able to show implementation and interoperability

<h2>2 <a id="Organization" name="Organization">Members, Advisory Committee,
Team, Advisory Board, Technical Architecture Group</a></h2>

<p>W3C's mission is to lead the Web to its full potential. W3C <a href="#Members">Member</a> organizations provide resources to this end, and the
W3C <a href="#Team">Team</a> provides the technical leadership and organization
to coordinate the effort.</p>

<h3>2.1 <a id="Members" name="Members">Members</a></h3>

<p>W3C Members are primarily represented in W3C processes as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>The <a href="#AC">Advisory Committee</a> is composed of one representative
from each Member organization (refer to the <a href="#Member-only">Member-only</a> list of <a href="http://www.w3.org/Member/ACList">current Advisory Committee
representatives</a> [<a href="#ref-current-ac">MEM1</a>]). The Advisory
Committee: 

<ul>
<li>reviews plans for W3C at each <a href="#ACMeetings">Advisory Committee
Meeting</a>;</li>

<li>reviews formal proposals from the W3C Director: <a href="#ActivityProposal">Activity Proposals</a>, <a href="#RecsPR">Proposed
Recommendations</a>, and <a href="#GAProcess">Proposed Process
Documents</a>.</li>

<li>elects the <a href="#AB">Advisory Board</a> participants other than the
Advisory Board Chair.</li>

<li>elects 5 of the 9 participants on the <a href="#TAG">Technical Architecture
Group</a>.</li>
</ul>

Advisory Committee representatives have <a href="#ACAppeal">appeal</a> powers
for some processes described in this document.</li>

<li>Representatives of Member organizations participate in <a href="#GAGeneral">Working Groups, Interest Groups, and Coordination Groups</a>
and author and review documents on the <a href="#Recs">Recommendation
Track</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p><a id="MemberSubscription" name="MemberSubscription">W3C membership</a> is
open to all entities, as described in "<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Prospectus/Joining">How to Join W3C</a>" [<a href="#ref-join-w3c">PUB5</a>]; (refer to the public list of <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List">current W3C Members</a> [<a href="#ref-current-mem">PUB8</a>]). Organizations subscribe according to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/Member-Agreement">Membership Agreement</a> [<a href="#ref-member-agreement">PUB6</a>]. The <a href="#Team">Team</a> <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> ensure that Member participation agreements remain
<a href="#Team-only">Team-only</a> and that no Member receives preferential
treatment within W3C.</p>

<p><a id="IndividualParticipation" name="IndividualParticipation">W3C does not
have a class of membership tailored to, or priced for individuals</a>. However,
an individual <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> join W3C as an Affiliate Member.
In this case the same restrictions pertaining to <a href="#MemberRelated">related Members</a> apply when the individual also <a href="#member-rep">represents</a> another W3C Member.</p>

<h4>2.1.1 <a id="MemberBenefits" name="MemberBenefits">Rights of
Members</a></h4>

<p>Each Member organization enjoys the following rights and benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>A seat on the <a href="#AC">Advisory Committee</a>;</li>

<li>Access to <a href="#Member-only">Member-only</a> information;</li>

<li>The <a href="#Submission">Member Submission</a> process;</li>

<li>Use of the W3C Member logo on promotional material and to publicize the
Member's participation in W3C. For more information, please refer to the Member
logo usage policy described in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Member/Intro">New
Member Orientation</a> [<a href="#ref-new-member">MEM4</a>].</li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, representatives of Member organizations participate in W3C as
follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>In <a href="#GAGeneral">Working Groups, Interest Groups, and Coordination
Groups</a>.</li>

<li>In <a href="#GAEvents">workshops and symposia</a>;</li>

<li>On the Team, as <a href="#fellows">W3C Fellows</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the case (described in paragraph 5g of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/Member-Agreement">Membership Agreement</a>),
where a Member organization is itself a consortium, user society, or otherwise
has members or sponsors, the organization's paid staff and Advisory Committee
representative exercise all the rights and privileges of W3C membership. In
addition, the Advisory Committee representative <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> designate up to four (or more at the Team's
discretion) individuals who, though not employed by the organization, <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> exercise the rights of <a href="#member-rep">Member
representatives</a>. These individuals <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
disclose their employment affiliation when participating in W3C work.
Provisions for <a href="#MemberRelated">related Members</a> apply. Furthermore,
these individuals are expected to represent the broad interests of the W3C
Member organization and not the parochial interests of their employers.</p>

<p>The rights and benefits of W3C membership are contingent upon conformance to
the processes described in this document. The vast majority of W3C Members
faithfully follow the spirit as well as the letter of these processes. When
serious and/or repeated violations do occur, and repeated attempts to address
these violations have not resolved the situation, the Director <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> take disciplinary action. Arbitration in the case of
further disagreement is governed by paragraph 19 of the Membership Agreement.
Refer to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/09/discipline">Guidelines for
Disciplinary Action</a> [<a href="#ref-discipline-gl">MEM14</a>].</p>

<h4>2.1.2 <a id="MemberRelated" name="MemberRelated">Related Members</a></h4>

<p>In the interest of ensuring the integrity of the consensus process, Member
involvement in some of the processes in this document is affected by related
Member status. As used herein, two Members are related if:</p>

<ol>
<li>Either Member is a subsidiary of the other, or</li>

<li>Both Members are subsidiaries of a common entity, or</li>

<li>The Members have an employment contract or consulting contract that affects
W3C participation.</li>
</ol>

<p>A <em>subsidiary</em> is an organization of which effective control and/or
majority ownership rests with another, single organization.</p>

<p>Related Members <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> disclose these
relationships according to the mechanisms described in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Member/Intro">New Member Orientation</a> [<a href="#ref-new-member">MEM4</a>].</p>

<h4>2.1.3 <a id="AC" name="AC">Advisory Committee (AC)</a></h4>

<p>When an organization joins W3C (see "<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Prospectus/Joining">How to Join W3C</a>" [<a href="#ref-join-w3c">PUB5</a>]), it <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> name its
Advisory Committee representative as part of the Membership Agreement. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Member/Intro">New Member Orientation</a> explains how
to subscribe or unsubscribe to Advisory Committee mailing lists, provides
information about Advisory Committee meetings, explains how to name a new
Advisory Committee representative, and more. Advisory Committee representatives
<span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> follow the <a href="#coi">conflict of
interest policy</a> by disclosing information according to the mechanisms
described in the New Member Orientation. Additional information for Members is
available at the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Member/">Member Web site</a> [<a href="#ref-member-web">MEM6</a>].</p>

<h5>2.1.3.1 <a id="ACCommunication" name="ACCommunication">Advisory Committee
Mailing Lists</a></h5>

<p>The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> provide two mailing lists for use
by the Advisory Committee:</p>

<ol>
<li>One for official announcements (e.g., those required by this document) from
the Team to the Advisory Committee. This list is read-only for Advisory
Committee representatives.</li>

<li>One for discussion among Advisory Committee representatives. Though this
list is primarily for Advisory Committee representatives, the Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> monitor discussion and <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> participate in discussion when appropriate.
Ongoing detailed discussions <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> be moved to
other appropriate lists (new or existing, such as a mailing list created for a
<a href="#GAEvents">workshop</a>).</li>
</ol>

<p>An Advisory Committee representative <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
request that additional individuals from their organization be subscribed to
these lists. Failure to contain distribution internally <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> result in suspension of additional email addresses,
at the discretion of the Team.</p>

<h5>2.1.3.2 <a id="ACMeetings" name="ACMeetings">Advisory Committee
Meetings</a></h5>

<p>The Team organizes a <a href="#ftf-meeting">face-to-face meeting</a> for the
Advisory Committee <span class="time-interval">twice a year</span>. The Team
appoints the Chair of these meetings (generally the <a href="#def-W3CChair" rel="glossary" title="Definition of W3C Chair"><span class="dfn-instance">W3C
Chair</span></a> or <a href="#def-COO" rel="glossary" title="Definition of Chief Operating Officer"><span class="dfn-instance">Chief
Operating Officer</span></a>). At each Advisory Committee meeting, the Team
<span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> provide an update to the Advisory Committee
about:</p>

<dl><dt><em>Resources</em></dt><dd>
<ul>
<li>The number of Full and Affiliate W3C Members.</li>

<li>An overview of the financial status of W3C.</li>
</ul>
</dd><dt><em>Allocations</em></dt><dd>
<ul>
<li>The allocation of the annual budget, including size of the Team and their
approximate deployment.</li>

<li>A list of all Activities and brief status statement about each, in
particular those started or terminated since the previous Advisory Committee
meeting.</li>

<li>The allocation of resources to pursuing <a href="#Liaisons">liaisons</a>
with other organizations.</li>
</ul>
</dd></dl>

<p>Each Member organization <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> send one <a href="#member-rep">representative</a> to each Advisory Committee meeting. In
exceptional circumstances (e.g., during a period of transition between
representatives from an organization), the meeting Chair <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> allow a Member organization to send two
representatives to a meeting.</p>

<p>The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> announce the date and location of
each Advisory Committee meeting no later than at the end of the previous
meeting; <span class="time-interval">one year's</span> notice is preferred. The
Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> announce the region of each Advisory
Committee meeting at least <span class="time-interval">one year</span> in
advance.</p>

<p>More information about <a href="http://www.w3.org/Member/Meeting/">Advisory
Committee meetings</a> [<a href="#ref-ac-meetings">MEM5</a>] is available at
the Member Web site.</p>

<h3>2.2 <a id="Team" name="Team">The W3C Team</a></h3>

<p>The Team consists of the W3C paid staff, unpaid interns, and W3C Fellows. <a id="fellows" name="fellows">W3C Fellows</a> are Member employees working as
part of the Team; see the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Recruitment/Fellows">W3C Fellows Program</a>
[<a href="#ref-fellows">PUB32</a>]. The Team provides technical leadership
about Web technologies, organizes and manages W3C Activities to reach goals
within practical constraints (such as resources available), and communicates
with the Members and the public about the Web and W3C technologies.</p>

<p>The Team is led by the Director, W3C Chair, and Chief Operating Officer.
These individuals <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> delegate responsibility
(generally to other individuals in the Team) for any of their roles described
in this document.</p>

<p>The <a id="def-Director" name="def-Director"><dfn><b>Director</b></dfn></a>
is the lead technical architect at W3C and as such, is responsible for
assessing <a id="DirectorDecision" name="DirectorDecision" href="#def-Consensus">consensus</a> within W3C for architectural choices,
publication of <a href="#Reports">technical reports</a>, and new <a href="#Activities">Activities</a>. The Director appoints group <a href="#GeneralChairs">Chairs</a> and has the role of "tie-breaker" for
questions of <a href="#good-standing">Good Standing</a> in a Working Group or
<a href="#WGAppeals">appeal of a Working Group decision</a>. The Director is
generally Chair of the <a href="#TAG">TAG</a>.</p>

<p>The <a id="def-W3CChair" name="def-W3CChair"><dfn><b>W3C Chair</b></dfn></a>
leads Member relations, and <a href="#Liaisons">liaisons</a> with other
organizations, governments, and the public.</p>

<p>The <a id="def-COO" name="def-COO"><dfn><b>Chief Operating
Officer</b></dfn></a> (<acronym>COO</acronym>) leads the operation of W3C as an
organization: a collection of people, <a href="#hosts">Host institutions</a>,
and processes.</p>

<p>Team administrative information such as Team salaries, detailed budgeting,
and other business decisions are <a href="#Team-only">Team-only</a>, subject to
oversight by the Host institutions.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> W3C is not currently incorporated. For legal
contracts, W3C is represented by three <a id="hosts" name="hosts">"Host"
institutions</a>: the European Research Consortium for Informatics and
Mathematics (<acronym>ERCIM</acronym>), Keio University, and the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (<acronym>MIT</acronym>). Within W3C, the Host
institutions are governed by joint sponsorship contracts; the Hosts themselves
are not W3C Members.</p>

<h4>2.2.1 <a id="TeamSubmission" name="TeamSubmission">Team
Submissions</a></h4>

<p>The Team <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> request that the Director publish
information at the W3C Web site. At the Director's discretion, these documents
are published as "Team Submissions". These documents are analogous to <a href="#Submission">Member Submissions</a> (e.g., in <a href="#SubmissionScope">expected scope</a>). However, there is no additional
Team comment.</p>

<p>Team Submissions are <strong>not</strong> part of the <a href="#Reports">Recommendation Track process</a>.</p>

<p>The list of <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/06/TeamSubmission">published
Team Submissions</a> [<a href="#ref-team-submission-list">PUB16</a>] is
available at the W3C Web site.</p>

<h3>2.3 <a id="AB" name="AB">Advisory Board (AB)</a></h3>

<p>Created in March 1998, the Advisory Board provides ongoing guidance to the
Team on issues of strategy, management, legal matters, process, and conflict
resolution. The Advisory Board also serves the Members by tracking issues
raised between Advisory Committee meetings, soliciting Member comments on such
issues, and proposing actions to resolve these issues. The Advisory Board
manages the <a href="#GAProcess">evolution of the Process Document</a>. The
Advisory Board hears appeals of <a href="#SubmissionNo">Member Submission
requests</a> that are rejected for reasons unrelated to Web architecture; see
also the <a href="#TAG">TAG</a>.</p>

<p>The Advisory Board is <strong>not</strong> a board of directors and has no
decision-making authority within W3C; its role is strictly advisory.</p>

<p>The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> make available a mailing list for
the Advisory Board to use for its communication, confidential to the Advisory
Board and Team.</p>

<p>The Advisory Board <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> send a summary of
each of its meetings to the Advisory Committee and other group Chairs. The
Advisory Board <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> also report on its
activities at each <a href="#ACMeetings">Advisory Committee meeting</a>.</p>

<p>Details about the Advisory Board (e.g., the list of Advisory Board
participants, mailing list information, and summaries of Advisory Board
meetings) are available at the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/ab/">Advisory
Board home page</a> [<a href="#ref-ab-home">PUB30</a>].</p>

<h4>2.3.1 <a id="ABParticipation" name="ABParticipation">Advisory Board
Participation</a></h4>

<p>The Advisory Board consists of nine elected participants and a Chair. The
Team appoints the Chair of the <a href="#AB">Advisory Board</a>, who is
generally the <a href="#def-W3CChair" rel="glossary" title="Definition of W3C Chair"><span class="dfn-instance">W3C
Chair</span></a>.</p>

<p>The remaining nine Advisory Board participants are elected by the W3C
Advisory Committee following the <a href="#AB-TAG-elections">AB/TAG nomination
and election process</a>.</p>

<p>With the exception of the Chair, the terms of all Advisory Board
participants are for <span class="time-interval">two years</span>. Terms are
staggered so that each year, either four or five terms expire. If an individual
is elected to fill an incomplete term, that individual's term ends at the
normal expiration date of that term. Regular Advisory Board terms begin on 1
July and end on 30 June.</p>

<h3>2.4 <a id="TAG" name="TAG">Technical Architecture Group (TAG)</a></h3>

<p>Created in February 2001, the mission of the TAG is stewardship of the Web
architecture. There are three aspects to this mission:</p>

<ol>
<li>to document and build consensus around principles of Web architecture and
to interpret and clarify these principles when necessary;</li>

<li>to resolve issues involving general Web architecture brought to the
TAG;</li>

<li>to help coordinate cross-technology architecture developments inside and
outside W3C.</li>
</ol>

<p>The TAG hears appeals of <a href="#SubmissionNo">Member Submission
requests</a> that are rejected for reasons related to Web architecture; see
also the <a href="#AB">Advisory Board</a>.</p>

<p>The TAG's scope is limited to technical issues about Web architecture. The
TAG <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD NOT</span> consider administrative, process,
or organizational policy issues of W3C, which are generally addressed by the
W3C Advisory Committee, Advisory Board, and Team. Please refer to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/07/19-tag">TAG charter</a> [<a href="#ref-tag-charter">PUB25</a>] for more information about the background
and scope of the TAG, and the expected qualifications of TAG participants.</p>

<p>The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> make available two mailing lists
for the TAG:</p>

<ul>
<li>a public discussion (not just input) list for issues of Web architecture.
The TAG will conduct its public business on this list.</li>

<li>a <a href="#Member-only">Member-only</a> list for discussions within the
TAG and for requests to the TAG that, for whatever reason, cannot be made on
the public list.</li>
</ul>

<p>The TAG <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> also request the creation of
additional topic-specific, public mailing lists. For some TAG discussions
(e.g., an appeal of a <a href="#SubmissionNo">rejected Member Submission
request</a>), the TAG <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> use a list that will be
<a href="#Member-only">Member-only</a>.</p>

<p>The TAG <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> send a summary of each of its <a href="#GeneralMeetings">meetings</a> to the Advisory Committee and other group
Chairs. The TAG <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> also report on its
activities at each <a href="#ACMeetings">Advisory Committee meeting</a>.</p>

<p>When the TAG votes to resolve an issue, each TAG participant (whether
appointed, elected, or the Chair) has one vote; see also the section on <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/07/19-tag#Voting">voting in the TAG charter</a>
[<a href="#ref-tag-charter">PUB25</a>] and the general section on <a href="#Votes">votes</a> in this Process Document.</p>

<p>Details about the TAG (e.g., the list of TAG participants, mailing list
information, and summaries of TAG meetings) are available at the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/">TAG home page</a> [<a href="#ref-tag-home">PUB26</a>].</p>

<h4>2.4.1 <a id="tag-participation" name="tag-participation">Technical
Architecture Group Participation</a></h4>

<p>The TAG consists of eight elected or appointed participants and a Chair. The
Team appoints the Chair of the TAG, who is generally the <a href="#def-Director" rel="glossary" title="Definition of Director"><span class="dfn-instance">Director</span></a>.</p>

<p>Three TAG participants are appointed by the Director. Appointees are <span class="rfc2119">NOT REQUIRED</span> to be on the W3C Team. The Director <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> appoint <a href="#fellows">W3C Fellows</a> to the
TAG.</p>

<p>The remaining five TAG participants are elected by the W3C Advisory
Committee following the <a href="#AB-TAG-elections">AB/TAG nomination and
election process</a>.</p>

<p>With the exception of the Chair, the terms of all TAG participants are for
<span class="time-interval">two years</span>. Terms are staggered so that each
year, either two or three elected terms, and either one or two appointed terms
expire. If an individual is appointed or elected to fill an incomplete term,
that individual's term ends at the normal expiration date of that term. Regular
TAG terms begin on 1 February and end on 31 January.</p>

<h3>2.5 <a id="AB-TAG-participation" name="AB-TAG-participation">Advisory Board
and Technical Architecture Group Participation</a></h3>

<p>Individuals on both the Advisory Board and the TAG participate as individual
contributors and not representatives of their organizations. Participants use
their best judgment to find the best solutions for the Web, not just for any
particular network, technology, vendor, or user.</p>

<p>Advisory Board and TAG participants are expected to participate regularly
and fully. An individual is an Advisory Board or TAG participant if the
individual has been elected or appointed, and if the individual is in <a href="#good-standing">Good Standing</a> as defined for Working Group
participants.</p>

<p>A participant on either the Advisory Board or the TAG who does not <a href="#member-rep">represent</a> a Member organization <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> agree to the terms of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/collaborators-agreement">invited
expert and collaborators agreement</a> [<a href="#ref-invited-expert">PUB17</a>]. Participants <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> follow the <a href="#coi">conflict of interest
policy</a> by disclosing information to their respective groups.</p>

<p>Advisory Board and TAG participants <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span>
attend <a href="#ACMeetings">Advisory Committee meetings</a>.</p>

<p>Given the few seats available on the Advisory Board and the TAG, and in
order to ensure that the diversity of W3C Members is represented:</p>

<ul>
<li>A Member organization is permitted at most one participant on the TAG.</li>

<li>A Member organization is permitted at most one participant on the AB.</li>

<li>An individual <span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> participate on both the
TAG and the AB.</li>
</ul>

<p>If, for whatever reason, these constraints are not satisfied (e.g., because
a TAG or AB participant changes jobs), one participant <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> cease TAG or AB participation until the situation
has been resolved. If after <span class="time-interval">30 days</span> the
situation has not been resolved, the Chair will declare one participant's seat
to be vacant. When more than one individual is involved, the <a href="#random">verifiable random selection procedure</a> described below will
be used to choose one person for continued participation.</p>

<h4>2.5.1 <a id="AB-TAG-elections" name="AB-TAG-elections">Advisory Board and
Technical Architecture Group Elections</a></h4>

<p>The Advisory Board and a portion of the Technical Architecture Group are
elected by the Advisory Committee.</p>

<p>An election begins when the Team sends a Call for Nominations to the
Advisory Committee. Any Call for Nominations specifies the number of available
seats, the deadline for nominations, and the address where nominations are
sent.</p>

<p>Each Member (or group of <a href="#MemberRelated">related Members</a>) <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> nominate one individual. A nominee is <span class="rfc2119">NOT REQUIRED</span> to be an employee of a Member organization,
and <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> be a <a href="#fellows">W3C
Fellow</a>.</p>

<p>A nomination <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be made with the consent of
the nominee, and the nominee <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> have employer
approval in order to participate. A nomination <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> include a few informative paragraphs about the
nominee.</p>

<p>If, after the deadline for nominations, the number of nominees is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Equal to the number of available seats, those nominees are thereby
elected.</li>

<li>Less than the number of available seats, Calls for Nominations are issued
until a sufficient number of people have been nominated. Those already
nominated do not need to be renominated after a renewed call.</li>

<li>Greater than the number of available seats, the Team issues a Call for
Votes that includes the names of all candidates, the number of available seats,
the deadline for votes, and the address where votes are sent.</li>
</ul>

<p>When there is a vote, each Member (or group of <a href="#MemberRelated">related Members</a>) <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
vote for as many candidates as there are available seats; see the section on <a href="#ACVotes">Advisory Committee votes</a>.</p>

<p>Once the deadline for votes has passed, the Team announces the results to
the Advisory Committee. The candidates with the most votes are elected to the
available seats. In case of a tie where there are more apparent winners than
available seats (e.g., three candidates receive 10 votes each for two seats),
the <a href="#random">verifiable random selection procedure</a> described below
will be used to fill the available seats.</p>

<p>Refer to <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/10/election-howto">How to Organize
an Advisory Board or TAG election</a> [<a href="#ref-election-howto">MEM15</a>]
for more details.</p>

<h5>2.5.1.1 <a name="random" id="random">Verifiable Random Selection
Procedure</a></h5>

<p>When it is necessary to use a verifiable random selection process (e.g., in
an AB or TAG election, to "draw straws" in case of a tie or to fill a short
term), W3C uses the random and verifiable procedure defined in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2777.txt">RFC 2777</a> [<a href="#ref-RFC2777">RFC2777</a>]. The procedure orders an input list of names
(listed in alphabetical order by family name unless otherwise specified) into a
"result order."</p>

<p>W3C applies this procedure as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>When N people have tied for M seats. In this case, only the names of the N
individuals who tied are provided as input to the procedure. The M seats are
assigned to individuals in result order.</li>

<li>When it is necessary to assign one or more short terms to elected
participants. In this case, the names of all elected individuals (after
resolution of ties) are provided as input to the procedure. Short terms are

<h2>3 <a id="Policies" name="Policies">General Policies for W3C Groups</a></h2>

<p>This section describes general policies for W3C groups regarding
participation, meeting requirements, and decision-making. These policies apply
to <a id="participant" name="participant">participants</a> in the following
groups: <a href="#AC">Advisory Committee</a>, <a href="#ABParticipation">Advisory Board</a>, <a href="#tag-participation">TAG</a>, <a href="#wgparticipant">Working Groups</a>,
<a href="#igparticipant">Interest Groups</a>, and <a href="#cgparticipant">Coordination Groups</a>.</p>

<h3>3.1 <a id="ParticipationCriteria" name="ParticipationCriteria">Individual
Participation Criteria</a></h3>

<p>There are three qualities an individual is expected to demonstrate in order
to participate in W3C:</p>

<ol>
<li>Technical competence in one's role</li>

<li>The ability to act fairly</li>

<li>Social competence in one's role</li>
</ol>

<p>Advisory Committee representatives who nominate individuals from their
organization for participation in W3C Activities are responsible for assessing
and attesting to the qualities of those nominees.</p>

<h4>3.1.1 <a id="coi" name="coi">Conflict of Interest Policy</a></h4>

<p>Individuals participating materially in W3C work <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> disclose significant relationships when those
relationships might reasonably be perceived as creating a conflict of interest
with the individual's role at W3C. These disclosures <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be kept up-to-date as the individual's affiliations
change and W3C membership evolves (since, for example, the individual might
have a relationship with an organization that joins or leaves W3C). Each
section in this document that describes a W3C group provides more detail about
the disclosure mechanisms for that group.</p>

<p>The ability of an individual to fulfill a role within a group without
risking a conflict of interest is clearly a function of the individual's
affiliations. When these affiliations change, the individual's assignment to
the role <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be evaluated. The role <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> be reassigned according to the appropriate process.
For instance, the Director <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> appoint a new group
Chair when the current Chair changes affiliations (e.g., if there is a risk of
conflict of interest, or if there is risk that the Chair's new employer will be
over-represented within a W3C Activity).</p>

<p>The following are some scenarios where disclosure is appropriate:</p>

<ul>
<li>Paid consulting for an organization whose activity is relevant to W3C, or
any consulting compensated with equity (shares of stock, stock options, or
other forms of corporate equity).</li>

<li>A decision-making role/responsibility (such as participating on the Board)
in other organizations relevant to W3C.</li>

<li>A position on a publicly visible advisory body, even if no decision making
authority is involved.</li>
</ul>

<p>Individuals seeking assistance on these matters <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> contact the Team.</p>

<p>Team members are subject to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/06-conflictpolicy">W3C Team conflict of
interest policy</a> [<a href="#ref-coi">PUB23</a>].</p>

<h4>3.1.2 <a id="member-rep" name="member-rep">Individuals Representing a
Member Organization</a></h4>

<p>Generally, individuals representing a Member in an official capacity within
W3C are employees of the Member organization. However, an Advisory Committee
representative <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> designate a non-employee to
represent the Member. Non-employee Member representatives <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> disclose relevant affiliations to the Team and to
any group in which the individual participates.</p>

<p>In exceptional circumstances (e.g., situations that might jeopardize the
progress of a group or create a <a href="#coi">conflict of interest</a>), the
<a href="#def-Director" rel="glossary" title="Definition of Director"><span class="dfn-instance">Director</span></a> <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
decline to allow an individual designated by an Advisory Committee
representative to participate in a group.</p>

<p>A group charter <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> limit the number of
individuals representing a W3C Member (or group of <a href="#MemberRelated">related Members</a>).</p>

<h3>3.2 <a id="GeneralMeetings" name="GeneralMeetings">Meetings</a></h3>

<p>W3C groups (including the <a href="#ACMeetings">Advisory Committee</a>, <a href="#AB">Advisory Board</a>, <a href="#TAG">TAG</a>, and <a href="#GroupsWG">Working Groups</a>) <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span>
observe the meeting requirements in this section.</p>

<p>W3C distinguishes two types of meetings:</p>

<ol>
<li>A <a id="ftf-meeting" name="ftf-meeting">face-to-face meeting</a> is one
where most of the attendees are expected to participate in the same physical
location.</li>

<li>A <a id="distributed-meeting" name="distributed-meeting">distributed
meeting</a> is one where most of the attendees are expected to participate from
remote locations (e.g., by telephone, video conferencing, or <acronym title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</acronym>).</li>
</ol>

<p>A Chair <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> invite an individual with a
particular expertise to attend a meeting on an exceptional basis. This person
is a meeting guest, not a group <a href="#participant">participant</a>. Meeting
guests do not have <a href="#Votes">voting rights</a>. It is the responsibility
of the Chair to ensure that all meeting guests respect the chartered <a href="#confidentiality-levels">level of confidentiality</a> and other group
requirements.</p>

<p>Meeting announcements <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> be sent to all
appropriate group mailing lists, i.e., those most relevant to the anticipated
meeting participants.</p>

<p>The following table lists requirements for organizing a meeting:</p>

<table summary="Requirements for face-to-face meetings and distributed meetings" border="1" cellpadding="5">

</table>

<p><sup>*</sup> To allow proper planning (e.g., travel arrangements), the Chair
is responsible for giving sufficient advance notice about the date and location
of a meeting. Shorter notice for a meeting is allowed provided that there are
no objections from group participants.</p>

<h3>3.3 <a id="Consensus" name="Consensus">Consensus</a></h3>

<p>The W3C process requires Chairs to ensure that groups consider all
legitimate views and objections, and endeavor to resolve them, whether these
views and objections are expressed by the active participants of the group or
by others (e.g., another W3C group, a group in another organization, or the
general public). Decisions <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> be made during
meetings (<a href="#ftf-meeting">face-to-face</a> or <a href="#distributed-meeting">distributed</a>) as well as through email. The
following terms are used in this document to describe the level of support for
a group decision:</p>

<ol>
<li><a id="def-Unanimity" name="def-Unanimity"><dfn><b>Unanimity</b></dfn></a>:
Everyone supports the decision.</li>

<li><a id="def-Consensus" name="def-Consensus"><dfn><b>Consensus</b></dfn></a>:
Nobody objects to the decision (but one or more people abstain).</li>

<li><a id="def-Dissent" name="def-Dissent"><dfn><b>Dissent</b></dfn></a>: At
least one person objects.</li>
</ol>

<p>Where unanimity is not possible, a group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span>
strive to make decisions where there is at least consensus with significant
support (i.e., few abstentions). To avoid decisions that are made despite
nearly universal apathy (i.e., with little support and many abstentions),
groups <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> set minimum thresholds of active
support before a decision can be recorded. The appropriate percentage <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> vary depending on the size of the group and the
nature of the decision. A group charter <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
include a quorum requirement for consensus decisions by participants.</p>

<p>In some cases, even after careful consideration of all points of view, a
group might find itself unable to reach consensus. When this happens, if there
is a need to advance (for example, to produce a deliverable in a timely
manner), the Chair <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> announce a decision to
which there is dissent. As part of making the decision, the Chair is expected
to be aware of which participants work for the same (or <a href="#MemberRelated">related</a>) Member organizations and weigh their input
accordingly. When a decision is made despite dissent, groups <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> favor proposals that create the least strong
objections. This is preferred over proposals that are supported by a large
majority but that cause strong objections from a few people.</p>

<p><a id="WGChairDecides" name="WGChairDecides">The Chair decides</a> when to
resolve an issue in the face of dissent. In this case a dissenter <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> register a <a href="#WGArchiveMinorityViews">formal
objection</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Director, W3C Chair, and COO have the role of
assessing consensus within the Advisory Committee.</p>

<h4>3.3.1 <a id="formal-address" name="formal-address">Formally Addressing an
Issue</a></h4>

<p>In the context of this document, a group has formally addressed an issue
when it has sent a substantive response to the reviewer who raised the issue. A
substantive response is expected to include rationale for decisions (e.g., a
technical explanation, a pointer to charter scope, or a pointer to a
requirements document). The adequacy of a response is measured against what a
W3C reviewer would generally consider to be technically sound.</p>

<p>If a group believes that a reviewer's comments result from a
misunderstanding, the group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> seek
clarification. The group's substantive response <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> remind the reviewer that, if dissatisfied with
the response, the reviewer has the right to register a <a href="#WGArchiveMinorityViews">formal objection</a>.</p>

<p>As a courtesy, both Chairs and reviewers <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span>
set expectations for the schedule of responses and acknowledgments. The group
<span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> reply to a reviewer's initial comments in a
timely manner. The group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> set a time limit
for acknowledgment by a reviewer of the group's substantive response; a
reviewer cannot block a group's progress. It is common for a reviewer to
require a week or more to acknowledge and comment on a substantive response.
The group's responsibility to respond to reviewers does not end once a
reasonable amount of time has elapsed. However, reviewers <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> realize that their comments will carry less
weight if not sent to the group in a timely manner.</p>

<p>Substantive responses <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> be recorded. The
group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> maintain an accurate summary of all
substantive issues and responses to them (e.g., in the form of an issues list
with links to mailing list archives).</p>

<h4>3.3.2 <a id="WGArchiveMinorityViews" name="WGArchiveMinorityViews">Recording and Reporting Formal
Objections</a></h4>

<p>If dissenters say they can live with a given decision, this is a sufficient
indication that the group can move on to the next topic, but the inverse is not
necessarily true: dissenters cannot stop a group's work simply by saying that
they cannot live with the decision. When the Chair believes that the legitimate
concerns of the dissenters have received due consideration as far as is
possible and reasonable, then objections <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be
recorded and the group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> move on.</p>

<p>A formal objection <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> include technical
arguments and propose changes that would remove the dissenter's objection;
these proposals <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> be vague or incomplete. The
Chair <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> report an objection that includes such
information to the Director at later review stages (e.g., in the request to the
Director to advance a technical report to Candidate Recommendation). If an
objection does not include this information, the Chair is <span class="rfc2119">NOT REQUIRED</span> to report it at later review stages.</p>

<p>During an Advisory Committee Review, Advisory Committee representatives
<span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be able to refer to recorded objections.</p>

<p>A version of each formal objection <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be <a href="#confidentiality-change">publicly available</a>.</p>

<h4>3.3.3 <a id="WGChairReopen" name="WGChairReopen">Reopening a Decision When
Presented With New Information</a></h4>

<p>The Chair <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> reopen a decision when presented
with new information, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>additional technical information,</li>

<li>comments by email from participants who were unable to attend a scheduled
meeting,</li>

<li>comments by email from meeting attendees who chose not to speak out during
a meeting (e.g., so they could confer later with colleagues or for cultural
reasons).</li>
</ul>

<p>The Chair <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> record that a decision has
been reopened, and <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> do so upon request from a
group participant.</p>

<h3>3.4 <a id="Votes" name="Votes">Votes</a></h3>

<p>A group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> only conduct a vote to resolve a
<em>substantive issue</em> after the Chair has determined that all available
means of <a href="#Consensus">reaching consensus</a> through technical
discussion and compromise have failed, and that a vote is necessary to break a
deadlock. In this case the Chair <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> record
(e.g., in the minutes of the meeting or in an archived email message):</p>

<ul>
<li>an explanation of the issue being voted on;</li>

<li>the decision to conduct a vote (e.g., a simple majority vote) to resolve
the issue;</li>

<li>the outcome of the vote;</li>

<li>any objections.</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to vote to resolve a substantive issue, an individual <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be a group <a href="#participant">participant</a>.
Each organization represented in the group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
have at most one vote, even when the organization is represented by several
participants in the group. For the purposes of voting:</p>

<ul>
<li>A Member or group of <a href="#MemberRelated">related Members</a> is
considered a single organization.</li>

<li>The <a href="#Team">Team</a> is considered an organization.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unless the charter states otherwise, <a href="#invited-expert-wg">invited
experts</a> <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> vote. Organizations represented by
one or more invited experts are subject to the same one vote limitation.</p>

<p>If a participant is unable to attend a vote, that individual <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> authorize anyone at the meeting to act as a <a id="proxy" name="proxy">proxy</a>. The absent participant <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> inform the Chair in writing who is acting as proxy,
with written instructions on the use of the proxy. For a Working Group or
Interest Group, see the related requirements regarding an individual who
attends a meeting as a <a href="#mtg-substitute">substitute</a> for a
participant.</p>

<p>A group <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> vote for other purposes than to
resolve a substantive issue. For instance, the Chair often conducts a "straw
poll" vote as a means of determining whether there is consensus about a
potential decision.</p>

<p>A group <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> also vote to make a process
decision. For example, it is appropriate to decide by simple majority whether
to hold a meeting in San Francisco or San Jose (there's not much difference
geographically). When simple majority votes are used to decide minor issues,
the minority are <span class="rfc2119">NOT REQUIRED</span> to state the reasons
for their dissent, and the group is <span class="rfc2119">NOT REQUIRED</span>
to record individual votes.</p>

<p>A group charter <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> include formal voting
procedures (e.g., quorum requirements or when a supermajority is required) for
making decisions about substantive issues.</p>

<p>Procedures for <a href="#ACVotes">Advisory Committee votes</a> are described
separately.</p>

<h3>3.5 <a id="WGAppeals" name="WGAppeals">Appeal of a Chair's
Decision</a></h3>

<p>Groups resolve issues through dialog. Individuals who disagree strongly with
a decision <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> register with the Chair any
objections (e.g., to a decision made as the result of a <a href="#Votes">vote</a>).</p>

<p>When group participants believe that their concerns are not being duly
considered by the group, they <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> ask the <a href="#def-Director" rel="glossary" title="Definition of Director"><span class="dfn-instance">Director</span></a> (for representatives of a Member
organization, via their Advisory Committee representative) to confirm or deny
the decision. The participants <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> also make
their requests known to the <a href="#TeamContact">Team Contact</a>. The Team
Contact <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> inform the Director when a group
participant has raised concerns about due process.</p>

<p>Any requests to the Director to confirm a decision <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> include a summary of the issue (whether technical
or procedural), decision, and rationale for the objection. All
counter-arguments, rationales, and decisions <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
be recorded.</p>

<p>Procedures for <a href="#ACAppeal">Advisory Committee appeals</a> are
described separately.</p>

<h2>4 <a id="dissemination" name="dissemination">Dissemination and Intellectual
Property Policies</a></h2>

<p>The Team is responsible for managing communication within W3C and with the
general public (e.g., news services, press releases, managing the Web site and
access privileges, and managing calendars). Members <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> solicit review by the Team prior to issuing press
releases about their work within W3C.</p>

<p>The Team makes every effort to ensure the availability of the following
public information:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#Reports">W3C technical reports</a> whose publication has been
approved by the Director. Per the Membership Agreement, W3C technical reports
(and software) are available free of charge to the general public; (refer to
the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-documents">W3C
Document License</a> [<a href="#ref-doc-license">PUB18</a>]).</li>

<li>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/">mission statement</a> [<a href="#ref-mission">PUB15</a>] that explains the purpose and mission of W3C,
the key benefits for Members, and the organizational structure of W3C.</li>

<li>Legal documents, including the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/Member-Agreement">Membership Agreement</a> [<a href="#ref-member-agreement">PUB6</a>]) and documentation of any legal
commitments W3C has with other entities.</li>

<li>The Process Document.</li>

<li>Public results of W3C Activities and <a href="#GAEvents">workshops</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>To keep the Members abreast of W3C meetings, workshops, and review
deadlines, the Team provides them with a regular (e.g., weekly) news service
and maintains a <a href="http://www.w3.org/Member/Eventscal">calendar</a> [<a href="#ref-calendar">MEM3</a>] of official W3C events. Members are encouraged
to send schedule and event information to the Team for inclusion on this
calendar.</p>

<h3>4.1 <a id="confidentiality-levels" name="confidentiality-levels">Confidentiality Levels</a></h3>

<p>There are three principal levels of access to information at the W3C Web
site: public, Member-only, and Team-only.</p>

<p>While much information made available by W3C is public, <a id="Member-only" name="Member-only">"Member-only" information</a> is available to authorized
parties only, including representatives of Member organizations, <a href="#invited-expert-wg">invited experts</a>, the Advisory Board, the TAG, and
the Team. For example, the <a href="#WGCharter">charter</a> of some Working
Groups may specify a Member-only confidentiality level for group
proceedings.</p>

<p><a id="Team-only" name="Team-only">"Team-only" information</a> is available
to the Team and other authorized parties.</p>

<p>Those authorized to access Member-only and Team-only information:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> treat the information as confidential
within W3C,</li>

<li><span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> use reasonable efforts to maintain the
proper level confidentiality, and</li>

<li><span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> release this information to the
general public or press.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> provide mechanisms to protect the
confidentiality of Member-only information and ensure that authorized parties
have proper access to this information. Documents <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> clearly indicate whether they require Member-only
confidentiality. Individuals uncertain of the confidentiality level of a piece
of information <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> contact the Team.</p>

<p>Advisory Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
authorize Member-only access to <a href="#member-rep">Member
representatives</a> and other individuals employed by the Member who are
considered appropriate recipients. For instance, it is the responsibility of
the Advisory Committee representative and other employees and official
representatives of the organization to ensure that Member-only news
announcements are distributed for internal use only within their organization.
Information about Member mailing lists is available in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Member/Intro">New Member Orientation</a>.</p>

<h4>4.1.1 <a id="confidentiality-change" name="confidentiality-change">Changing
Confidentiality Level</a></h4>

<p>As a benefit of membership, W3C provides some Team-only and Member-only
channels for certain types of communication. For example, Advisory Committee
representatives can send <a href="#ACReview">reviews</a> to a Team-only
channel. However, for W3C processes with a significant public component, such
as the Recommendation Track process, it is also important for information that
affects decision-making to be publicly available. The Team <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> need to communicate Team-only information to a
Working Group or the public. Similarly, a Working Group whose proceedings are
Member-only <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> make public information pertinent
to the Recommendation Track process.</p>

<p>This document clearly indicates which information <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be available to Members or the public, even though
that information was initially communicated on Team-only or Member-only
channels. Only the Team and parties authorized by the Team change the level of
confidentiality of this information. When doing so:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> use a version of the information
that was expressly provided by the author for the new confidentiality level. In
Calls for Review and other similar messages, the Team <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> remind recipients to provide such
alternatives.</li>

<li>The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> attribute the version for
the new confidentiality level to the author without the author's consent.</li>

<li>If the author has not conveyed to the Team a version that is suitable for
another confidentiality level, the Team <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> make
available a version that reasonably communicates what is required, while
respecting the original level of confidentiality, and without attribution to
the original author.</li>
</ol>

<h3>4.2 <a id="ipr" name="ipr">Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)
Policy</a></h3>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> In May 2003, W3C approved a new patent policy. The
IPR policy described in this section is unchanged since the previous Process
Document and does not take the new patent policy into account. W3C expects to
publish a new Process Document in the fourth quarter of 2003 that is aligned
with the new patent policy.</p>

<p>Whenever possible, technical decisions <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span>
be made unencumbered by intellectual property right (IPR) claims. To this end,
W3C discloses to the entire membership which organizations have made IPR claims
about a particular technology, as well as the details of those claims where
they have been provided. Individuals <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span>
immediately disclose any IPR claims they believe to be essential to
implementing a <a href="#Recs">Recommendation Track technical report</a>. To
disclose patent and IPR claims, individuals <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
send email to <a href="mailto:patent-issues@w3.org">patent-issues@w3.org</a>,
which is an archived mailing list readable by Members and the Team. Individuals
disclosing knowledge of IPR claims <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> copy the
<a href="#TeamContact">Team Contact</a> responsible for a particular technology
to ensure that the disclosure receives prompt consideration. Individuals <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> also copy other recipients.</p>

<p>Advisory Committee representatives are responsible for facilitating
communication with IPR contacts in their organizations. When disclosing IPR
claims, <a href="#member-rep">Member representatives</a> <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> copy their Advisory Committee representative.</p>

<p>An IPR disclosure about a given subject includes the following language
(appropriately completed):</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>I (do not) have personal knowledge of (any) IPR claims held by
[organization] regarding [subject].</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whenever possible, a disclosure <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> provide
detail about the claims.</p>

<p>Activity Proposals, announcements of group creation or extension, and other
important announcements and Web pages <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span>
include reminders of this IPR policy.</p>

Activity, the Team sends an <a href="#ActivityProposal">Activity Proposal</a>
to the Advisory Committee. This is a proposal to dedicate Team and Member
resources to a particular area of Web technology or policy, and when there is
consensus about the motivation, scope, and structure of the proposed work, W3C
starts a new Activity.</p>

<p>Each Activity has its own structure that generally includes Working Groups,
Interest Groups, and Coordination Groups. Within the framework of an Activity,
these groups produce technical reports, review the work of other groups, and
develop sample code or test suites.</p>

<p>The progress of each Activity is documented in an <a id="ActivityStatement" name="ActivityStatement">Activity Statement</a>. Activity Statements describe
the goals of the Activity, completed and unfinished deliverables, changing
perspectives based on experience, and future plans. At least before each <a href="#ACMeetings">Advisory Committee meeting</a>, the Team <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> revise the Activity Statement for each Activity
that has not been closed.</p>

<p>Refer to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Activities">list of W3C
Activities</a> [<a href="#ref-activity-list">PUB9</a>]. <strong>Note:</strong>
This list <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> include some Activities that began
prior to the formalization in 1997 of the Activity creation process.</p>

<h3>5.1 <a id="ActivityDevelopment" name="ActivityDevelopment">Activity
Proposal Development</a></h3>

<p>The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> notify the Advisory Committee
when a proposal for a new or modified Activity is in development. This is
intended to raise awareness, even if no formal proposal is yet available.
Advisory Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> express
their general support on the <a href="#ACCommunication">Advisory Committee
discussion list</a>. The Team <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> incorporate
discussion points into an Activity Proposal. Refer to additional <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/05/rec-tips">tips on getting to Recommendation
faster</a> [<a href="#ref-rec-tips">PUB27</a>].</p>

<h3>5.2 <a id="ActivityCreation" name="ActivityCreation">Advisory Committee
Review</a> of an Activity Proposal</h3>

<p>The Director <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> solicit <a href="#ReviewAppeal">Advisory Committee Review</a> of every proposal to create,
substantively modify, or extend an Activity.</p>

<p>After a Call for Review from the Director, the Advisory Committee <a href="#ACReview">reviews</a> and comments on the proposal. The review period
<span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be at least <span class="time-interval">four
weeks</span>. During the review period, Advisory Committee representatives
disclose knowledge of relevant IPR claims, according to the <a href="#ipr">W3C
IPR policy</a>.</p>

<p>The Director announces to the Advisory Committee whether there is consensus
within W3C to create or modify the Activity (possibly with changes suggested
during the review). For a new Activity, this announcement officially creates
the Activity. This announcement <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> include a <a href="#cfp">Call for Participation</a> in any groups created as part of the
Activity.</p>

<p>If there was <a href="#def-Dissent" rel="glossary" title="Definition of Dissent"><span class="dfn-instance">dissent</span></a>,
Advisory Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> <a href="#ACAppeal">appeal</a> a decision to create, modify, or extend the
Activity. <strong>Note:</strong> There is no appeal of a decision <em>not</em>
to create an Activity; in general, drafting a new Activity Proposal will be
simpler than following the appeal process.</p>

<h3>5.3 <a id="ActivityModification" name="ActivityModification">Modification
of an Activity</a></h3>

<p>Activities are intended to be flexible. W3C expects participants to be able
to adapt in the face of new ideas (e.g., Member Submission requests) and
increased understanding of goals and context, while remaining true to the
intent of the original Activity Proposal. If it becomes necessary to make
substantive changes to an Activity (e.g., because significant additional
resources are necessary or because the Activity's scope has clearly changed
from the original proposal), then the Director <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> solicit <a href="#ActivityCreation">Advisory
Committee Review</a> of a complete <a href="#BPCreation">Activity Proposal</a>,
including rationale for the changes.</p>

<h3>5.4 <a id="ActivityExtension" name="ActivityExtension">Extension of an
Activity</a></h3>

<p>When the Director solicits <a href="#ActivityCreation">Advisory Committee
review</a> of a proposal to extend the duration of an Activity with no other
substantive modifications to the composition of the Activity, the proposal
<span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> indicate the new duration and include
rationale for the extension. The Director is <span class="rfc2119">NOT
REQUIRED</span> to submit a complete <a href="#BPCreation">Activity
Proposal</a>.</p>

<h3>5.5 <a id="ActivityTermination" name="ActivityTermination">Activity
Closure</a></h3>

<p>An Activity Proposal specifies a duration for the Activity. The Director,
subject to <a href="#ACAppeal">appeal</a> by Advisory Committee
representatives, <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> close an Activity prior to
the date specified in the proposal in any of the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
<li>Groups in the Activity fail to produce chartered deliverables.</li>

<li>Groups in the Activity produce chartered deliverables ahead of
schedule.</li>

<li>There are insufficient resources to maintain the Activity, according to
priorities established within W3C.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Director closes an Activity by announcement to the Advisory
Committee.</p>

<h3>5.6 <a id="BPCreation" name="BPCreation"></a><a id="ActivityProposal" name="ActivityProposal">Activity Proposals</a></h3>

<p>An Activity Proposal defines the initial scope and structure of an Activity.
The proposal <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> include or reference the
following information:</p>

<ul>
<li>An Activity summary. What is the nature of the Activity (e.g., to track
developments, create technical reports, develop code, organize pilot
experiments, or for education)? Who or what group wants this (providers or
users)?</li>

<li>Context information. Why is this Activity being proposed now? What is the
situation in the world (e.g., with respect to the Web community, market,
research, or society)? within the scope of the proposal? Who or what currently
exists that is pertinent to this Activity? Is the community
mature/growing/developing a niche? What competing technologies exist? What
competing organizations exist?</li>

<li>A description of the Activity's scope. How might a potential Recommendation
interact and overlap with existing international standards and Recommendations?
What organizations are likely to be affected by potential overlap (see the
section on <a href="#Liaisons">liaisons with other organizations</a>)? What
should be changed if the Activity is approved?</li>

<li>A description of the Activity's initial deployment, including: 

<ul>
<li>The duration of the Activity.</li>

<li>What <a href="#GAGroups">groups</a> will be created as part of this
Activity and how those groups will be coordinated. For each group, the proposal
<span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> include a provisional charter. Groups <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> be scheduled to run concurrently or sequentially
(either because of a dependency or an expected overlap in membership and the
desirability of working on one subject at a time). These charters <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> be amended based on review comments before the
Director issues a <a href="#cfp">Call for Participation</a>.</li>

<li>The expected timeline of the Activity, including proposed deliverable dates
and scheduled <a href="#GAEvents">workshops and symposia</a>.</li>

<li>If known, the date of the first <a href="#ftf-meeting">face-to-face
meeting</a> of each proposed group. The date of the first face-to-face meeting
of a proposed group <span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> be sooner than <span class="time-interval">eight weeks</span> after the date of the <a href="#ActivityProposal">Activity Proposal</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>A summary of resources (Member, Team, administrative, technical, and
financial) expected to be dedicated to the Activity. The proposal <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> specify the threshold level of effort that Members
are expected to pledge in order for the Activity to be accepted.</li>

<li>Information about known dependencies within W3C or outside of W3C.</li>

<li>Intellectual property information. What intellectual property (for example,
an implementation) has to be available for licensing? The proposal <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> remind Advisory Committee representatives to
disclose, according to <a href="#ipr">W3C's IPR policy</a>, knowledge of
relevant IPR claims.</li>

<li>A list of supporters and references. What community is expected to benefit
from this Activity? Are members of this community part of W3C now? Are they
expected to join the effort?</li>
</ul>

<h2>6 <a id="GAGeneral" name="GAGeneral">Working Groups, Interest Groups, and
Coordination Groups</a></h2>

<p><a id="GAGroups" name="GAGroups">This document defines three types of
groups:</a></p>

<ol>
<li><a href="#GroupsWG">Working Groups.</a> Working Groups typically produce
deliverables (e.g., <a href="#rec-advance">Recommendation Track technical
reports</a>, software, test suites, and reviews of the deliverables of other
groups). There are <a href="#good-standing">Good Standing</a> requirements for
Working Group participation.</li>

<li><a href="#GroupsIG">Interest Groups.</a> The primary goal of an Interest
Group is to bring together people who wish to evaluate potential Web
technologies and policies. An Interest Group is a forum for the exchange of
ideas. In general, there are no Good Standing requirements for an Interest
Group. Interest Groups do not create W3C Recommendations.</li>

<li><a href="#GroupsCG">Coordination Groups.</a> A Coordination Group manages
dependencies and facilitates communication with other groups, within or outside
of W3C.</li>
</ol>

<h3>6.1 <a id="ReqsAllGroups" name="ReqsAllGroups">Requirements for All
Working, Interest, and Coordination Groups</a></h3>

<p>Each group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> have a charter. Requirements
for the charter depend on the group type. All group charters <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be public (even if other proceedings of the group
are <a href="#Member-only">Member-only</a>). Existing charters that are not yet
public <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be made public when next revised or
extended (with attention to <a href="#confidentiality-change">changing
confidentiality level</a>).</p>

<p>Each group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> have a <a id="GeneralChairs" name="GeneralChairs">Chair</a> (or co-Chairs) to coordinate the group's tasks.
The Director appoints (and re-appoints) Chairs for all groups. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Guide/chair-roles">role of the Chair [MEM14]</a> is described in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Guide/">Member Guide</a> [<a href="#ref-guide">MEM9</a>].</p>

<p>Each group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> have a <a id="TeamContact" name="TeamContact">Team Contact</a>, who acts as the interface between the
Chair, group participants, and the rest of the Team. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Guide/staff-contact">role of the Team Contact</a> is described in the
Member Guide.</p>

<p>The Chair and the Team Contact of a group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD
NOT</span> be the same individual. The Chair <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
be a member of the <a href="#Team">Team</a>.</p>

<p>Each group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> have an archived mailing list
for formal group communication (e.g., for meeting announcements and minutes,
documentation of decisions, and objections to decisions). It is the
responsibility of the Chair and Team Contact to ensure that new participants
are subscribed to all relevant mailing lists. Refer to the list of <a href="http://www.w3.org/Member/Mail/">group mailing lists</a> [<a href="#ref-mailing-lists">MEM2</a>].</p>

<p>A Chair <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> form task forces (composed of group
participants) to carry out assignments for the group. The scope of these
assignments <span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> exceed the scope of the
group's charter. A group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> document the
process it uses to create task forces (e.g., each task force might have an
informal "charter"). Task forces do not publish <a href="#Reports">technical
reports</a>; the Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> choose to
publish their results as part of a technical report.</p>

<h3>6.2 <a id="GroupsWG" name="GroupsWG">Working Groups</a> and <a id="GroupsIG" name="GroupsIG">Interest Groups</a></h3>

<p>Although Working Groups and Interest Groups have different purposes, they
share some characteristics, and so are defined together in the following
sections.</p>

<h4>6.2.1 <a id="group-participation" name="group-participation">Working Group
and Interest Group Participation Requirements</a></h4>

<p>There are four types of <a id="wgparticipant" name="wgparticipant">participants in a Working Group</a>: the <a href="#GeneralChairs">Chair</a>, <a href="#member-rep">Member
representatives</a>, <a href="#invited-expert-wg">invited experts</a>, and <a href="#Team">Team representatives</a> (including the <a href="#TeamContact">Team Contact</a>).</p>

<p>There are <a id="igparticipant" name="igparticipant">five types of
participants in an Interest Group</a>: the same four types as for Working
Groups plus, for an Interest Group where the only <a href="#ig-mail-only">participation requirement is mailing list
subscription</a>, <a id="public-participant-ig" name="public-participant-ig">public participants</a>.</p>

<p>Except where noted in this document or in a group charter, all participants
share the same rights and responsibilities in a group; see also the <a href="#ParticipationCriteria">individual participation criteria</a>.</p>

<p>A participant <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> represent at most one
organization in a Working Group or Interest Group.</p>

<p>An individual <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> become a Working or Interest
Group participant at any time during the group's existence.</p>

<p>On an exceptional basis, a Working or Interest Group participant <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> designate a <a id="mtg-substitute" name="mtg-substitute">substitute</a> to attend a <a href="#GeneralMeetings">meeting</a> and <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span>
inform the Chair. The substitute <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> act on behalf
of the participant, including for <a href="#Votes">votes</a>. For the
substitute to vote, the participant <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> inform
the Chair in writing in advance. As a courtesy to the group, if the substitute
is not well-versed in the group's discussions, the regular participant <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> authorize another participant to act as <a href="#proxy">proxy</a> for votes.</p>

<p>To allow rapid progress, Working Groups are intended to be small (typically
fewer than 15 people) and composed of experts in the area defined by the
charter. In principle, Interest Groups have no limit on the number of
participants. When a Working Group grows too large to be effective, W3C <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> split it into an Interest Group (a discussion forum)
and a much smaller Working Group (a core group of highly dedicated
participants).</p>

<h5>6.2.1.1 <a id="member-rep-wg" name="member-rep-wg">Member
Representative</a> in a Working Group</h5>

<p>An individual is a Member representative in a Working Group if all of the
following conditions are satisfied:</p>

<ul>
<li>the Advisory Committee representative of the Member in question has
designated the individual as a Working Group participant,</li>

<li>the individual qualifies for <a href="#member-rep">Member
representation</a>, and</li>

<li>the individual is in <a href="#good-standing">Good Standing</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>A Member organization participates in a Working Group if at least one
individual satisfies these criteria for the Member.</p>

<p>To designate an individual as a Member representative in a Working Group, an
Advisory Committee representative <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> provide the
Chair and Team Contact with all of the following information, in addition to
any other information required by the <a href="#cfp">Call for Participation</a>
and charter:</p>

<ol>
<li>The name of the W3C Member the individual represents and whether the
individual is an employee of that Member organization</li>

<li>A disclosure, according to the <a href="#ipr">W3C IPR policy</a>, of
knowledge of relevant IPR claims by the organization the individual is
representing</li>

<li>A statement that the individual accepts the participation terms set forth
in the charter (with an indication of charter date or version)</li>

<li>A statement that the Member will provide the necessary financial support
for participation (e.g., for travel, telephone calls, and conferences)</li>
</ol>

<h5>6.2.1.2 <a id="member-rep-ig" name="member-rep-ig">Member
Representative</a> in an Interest Group</h5>

<p>When the participation requirements exceed <a href="#ig-mail-only">Interest
Group mailing list subscription</a>, an individual is a Member representative
in an Interest Group if all of the following conditions are satisfied:</p>

<ul>
<li>the Advisory Committee representative of the Member in question has
designated the individual as an Interest Group participant, and</li>

<li>the individual qualifies for <a href="#member-rep">Member
representation</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A Member organization participates in an Interest Group if at least one
individual satisfies these criteria for the Member.</p>

<p>To designate an individual as a Member representative in an Interest Group,
the Advisory Committee representative <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> follow
the instructions in the <a href="#cfp">Call for Participation</a> and
charter.</p>

<h5>6.2.1.3 <a id="invited-expert-wg" name="invited-expert-wg">Invited
Expert</a> in a Working Group</h5>

<p>The Chair <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> invite an individual with a
particular expertise to participate in a Working Group. This individual <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> represent an organization in the group (e.g., if
acting as a liaison with another organization).</p>

<p>An individual is an invited expert in a Working Group if all of the
following conditions are satisfied:</p>

<ul>
<li>the Chair has designated the individual as a group participant,</li>

<li>the Team Contact has agreed with the Chair's choice,</li>

<li>the individual has provided the <a href="#inv-expert-info">information
required of an invited expert</a> to the Chair and Team Contact, and</li>

<li>the individual is in <a href="#good-standing">Good Standing</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>To designate an individual as an invited expert in a Working Group, the
Chair <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> inform the Team Contact and provide
rationale for the choice. When the Chair and the Team Contact disagree about a
designation, the <a href="#def-Director" rel="glossary" title="Definition of Director"><span class="dfn-instance">Director</span></a>
determines whether the individual will be invited to participate in the Working
Group.</p>

<p><a id="inv-expert-info" name="inv-expert-info">To be able to participate in
a Working Group as an invited expert</a>, an individual <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> do all of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>identify the organization, if any, the individual represents as a
participant in this group,</li>

<li>agree to the terms of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/collaborators-agreement">invited
expert and collaborators agreement</a> [<a href="#ref-invited-expert">PUB17</a>],</li>

<li>accept the participation terms set forth in the charter (with an indication
of charter date or version),</li>

<li>disclose whether the individual is an employee of a W3C Member; see the <a href="#coi">conflict of interest policy</a>,</li>

<li>disclose, according to the <a href="#ipr">W3C IPR policy</a>, knowledge of
relevant IPR claims of which the individual is aware,</li>

<li>provide a statement of who will provide the necessary financial support for
the individual's participation (e.g., for travel, telephone calls, and
conferences), and</li>

<li>if the individual's employer (including a self-employed individual) or the
organization the individual represents is not a W3C Member, indicate whether
that organization intends to join W3C. If the organization does not intend to
join W3C, indicate reasons the individual is aware of for this choice.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Chair <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD NOT</span> designate as an invited
expert in a Working Group an individual who is an employee of a W3C Member. The
Chair <span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> use invited expert status to
circumvent participation limits imposed by the <a href="#WGCharter">charter</a>.</p>

<h5>6.2.1.4 <a id="invited-expert-ig" name="invited-expert-ig">Invited
Expert</a> in an Interest Group</h5>

<p>When the participation requirements exceed <a href="#ig-mail-only">Interest
Group mailing list subscription</a>, the participation requirements for an
invited expert in an Interest Group are the same as those for an <a href="#invited-expert-wg">invited expert in a Working Group</a>, except that
Good Standing is not required.</p>

<h5>6.2.1.5 <a id="team-rep-wg" name="team-rep-wg">Team Representative in a
Working Group</a></h5>

<p>An individual is a Team representative in a Working Group if all of the
following conditions are satisfied:</p>

<ul>
<li>W3C management has designated the individual as a Working Group
participant, and</li>

<li>the individual is in <a href="#good-standing">Good Standing</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h5>6.2.1.6 <a id="team-rep-ig" name="team-rep-ig">Team Representative in an
Interest Group</a></h5>

<p>When the participation requirements exceed <a href="#ig-mail-only">Interest
Group mailing list subscription</a>, an individual is a Team representative in
an Interest Group when so designated by W3C management.</p>

<h5>6.2.1.7 <a id="good-standing" name="good-standing">Good Standing in a
Working Group</a></h5>

<p>Participation in a Working Group on an ongoing basis implies a serious
commitment to the charter, including all of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>attending most meetings of the Working Group.</li>

<li>providing deliverables or drafts of deliverables in a timely fashion.</li>

<li>being familiar with the relevant documents of the Working Group, including
minutes of past meetings.</li>

<li>following discussions on relevant mailing list(s).</li>
</ul>

<p>When the Chair and the <a href="#TeamContact">Team Contact</a> agree, the
Chair <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> declare that a participant is no longer
in Good Standing (henceforth called "Bad Standing"). If there is disagreement
between the Chair and the Team Contact about standing, the Director determines
the participant's standing. The Chair <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> declare
a Team participant to be in Bad Standing, but it is clearly preferable for the
Chair, Team participant, and W3C management to resolve issues internally.</p>

<p>A participant <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> be declared in Bad Standing
in any of the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
<li>the individual has missed more than one of the last three <a href="#distributed-meeting">distributed meetings</a>.</li>

<li>the individual has missed more than one of the last three <a href="#ftf-meeting">face-to-face meetings</a>.</li>

<li>the individual has not provided deliverables in a timely fashion twice in
sequence.</li>

<li>the individual has not followed the <a href="#coi">conflict of interest
policy</a> by disclosing information to the rest of the group.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although all participants representing an organization <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> attend all meetings, attendance by one
representative of an organization satisfies the meeting attendance requirement
for all representatives of the organization.</p>

<p>The above criteria <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> be relaxed if the Chair
and Team Contact agree that doing so will not set back the Working Group. For
example, the attendance requirement can be relaxed for reasons of expense
(e.g., cost of travel) or scheduling (for example, an exceptional
teleconference is scheduled at 3:00 a.m. local time for the participant). It is
the responsibility of the Chair and Team Contact to apply criteria for Good
Standing consistently.</p>

<p>When a participant risks losing Good Standing, the Chair and Team Contact
are expected to discuss the matter with the participant and the participant's
Advisory Committee representative (or W3C management for the Team) before
declaring the participant in Bad Standing.</p>

<p>The Chair declares a participant in Bad Standing by informing the
participant's Advisory Committee representative and the participant of the
decision. If the Advisory Committee representative and Chair differ in opinion,
the Advisory Committee representative <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> ask the
<a href="#def-Director" rel="glossary" title="Definition of Director"><span class="dfn-instance">Director</span></a> to confirm or deny the decision. <a href="#invited-expert-wg">Invited experts</a> declared in Bad Standing <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> appeal to the Director.</p>

<p>The Chair and Team Contact restore Good Standing and <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> do so when the individual in Bad Standing
satisfies the above criteria. The Chair <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
inform the individual's Advisory Committee representative of any change in
standing.</p>

<h4>6.2.2 <a id="WGCharterDevelopment" name="WGCharterDevelopment">Working
Group and Interest Group Charter Development</a></h4>

<p>The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> notify the Advisory Committee
when a charter for a new Working Group or Interest Group is in development. The
suggestions for building support around an <a href="#ActivityDevelopment">Activity Proposal</a> apply to charters as
well.</p>

<p>W3C <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> begin work on a Working Group or
Interest Group charter at any time. A Working Group or Interest Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be part of an approved <a href="#def-Activity" rel="glossary" title="Definition of Activity"><span class="dfn-instance">Activity</span></a>.</p>

<h4>6.2.3 <a id="CharterReview" name="CharterReview">Advisory Committee
Review</a> of a Working Group or Interest Group Charter</h4>

<p>The Director <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> solicit <a href="#ReviewAppeal">Advisory Committee Review</a> of every new or
substantively modified Working Group or Interest Group charter. The Director is
<span class="rfc2119">NOT REQUIRED</span> to solicit Advisory Committee Review
prior to a charter extension or for minor changes.</p>

<p>The Director's call for review of a substantively modified charter <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> highlight important changes (e.g., regarding
deliverables or resource allocation) and include rationale for the changes.</p>

<h4>6.2.4 <a id="cfp" name="cfp">Call for Participation in a Working Group or
Interest Group</a></h4>

<p>After Advisory Committee Review of a Working Group or Interest Group
charter, the Director <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> issue a Call for
Participation to the Advisory Committee. For a new group, this announcement
officially creates the group. The announcement <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> include a reference to the <a href="#WGCharter">charter</a>, the name(s) of the group's <a href="#GeneralChairs">Chair(s)</a>, and the name of the <a href="#TeamContact">Team Contact</a>.</p>

<p>After a Call for Participation, any <a href="#member-rep">Member
representatives</a> and <a href="#invited-expert-wg">invited experts</a> <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be designated (or re-designated).</p>

<p>Advisory Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> <a href="#ACAppeal">appeal</a> creation or substantive modification of a Working
Group or Interest Group charter.</p>

<h4>6.2.5 <a id="charter-extension" name="charter-extension">Working Group and
Interest Group Charter Extension</a></h4>

<p>To extend a Working Group or Interest Group charter with no other
substantive modifications, the Director announces the extension to the Advisory
Committee. The announcement <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> indicate the new
duration, which <span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> exceed the duration of
the Activity to which the group belongs. The announcement <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> also include rationale for the extension, a
reference to the <a href="#WGCharter">charter</a>, the name(s) of the group's
<a href="#GeneralChairs">Chair(s)</a>, the name of the <a href="#TeamContact">Team Contact</a>, and instructions for joining the
group.</p>

<p>After a charter extension, Advisory Committee representatives and the Chair
are <span class="rfc2119">NOT REQUIRED</span> to re-designate <a href="#member-rep">Member representatives</a> and <a href="#invited-expert-wg">invited experts</a>.</p>

<p>Advisory Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> <a href="#ACAppeal">appeal</a> the extension of a Working Group or Interest Group
charter.</p>

<h4>6.2.6 <a id="WGCharter" name="WGCharter">Working Group and Interest Group
Charters</a></h4>

<p>A Working Group or Interest Group charter <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
include all of the following information.</p>

<ul>
<li>The group's mission (e.g., develop a technology or process, review the work
of other groups);</li>

<li>The scope of the group's work and criteria for success;</li>

<li>The duration of the group (typically from six months to two years);</li>

<li>The nature of any deliverables (technical reports, reviews of the
deliverables of other groups, or software), expected milestones, and the
process for the group participants to approve the release of these deliverables
(including public intermediate results). A charter is <span class="rfc2119">NOT
REQUIRED</span> to include the schedule for a review of another group's
deliverables;</li>

<li>Any dependencies by groups within or outside of W3C on the deliverables of
this group. For any dependencies, the charter <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
specify the mechanisms for communication about the deliverables;</li>

<li>Any dependencies of this group on other groups within or outside of W3C.
For example, one group's charter might specify that another group is expected
to review a technical report before it can become a Recommendation. For any
dependencies, the charter <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> specify when
required deliverables are expected from the other groups. The charter <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> set expectations about how coordination with
those groups will take place; see the section on <a href="#Liaisons">liaisons
with other organizations</a>. Finally, the charter <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> specify expected conformance to the deliverables
of the other groups;</li>

<li>The <a href="#confidentiality-levels">level of confidentiality</a> of the
group's proceedings and deliverables;</li>

<li>IPR disclosure requirements (see <a href="#ipr">W3C's IPR policy</a>);</li>

<li>Meeting mechanisms and expected frequency;</li>

<li>Communication mechanisms to be employed within the group, between the group
and the rest of W3C, and with the general public;</li>

<li>An estimate of the expected time commitment from participants;</li>

<li>The expected level of involvement by the Team (e.g., to track developments,
write and edit technical reports, develop code, or organize pilot
experiments).</li>
</ul>

<p>An Interest Group charter <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> specify that the
<a id="ig-mail-only" name="ig-mail-only">only requirement for participation (by
anyone) in the Interest Group</a> is subscription to the Interest Group mailing
list. This type of Interest Group <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> have <a href="#public-participant-ig">public participants</a>.</p>

<p>A charter <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> include additional voting
procedures, but those procedures <span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> conflict
with the <a href="#Votes">voting requirements</a> of the Process Document.</p>

<p>A charter <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> include provisions other than
those required by this document. The charter <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> highlight whether additional provisions impose
constraints beyond those of the W3C Process Document (e.g., limits on the
number of individuals in a Working Group who represent the same Member
organization or group of <a href="#MemberRelated">related Members</a>).</p>

<h4>6.2.7 <a id="three-month-rule" name="three-month-rule">Working Group
"Heartbeat" Requirement</a></h4>

<p>When a Working Group has one or more technical reports in the <a href="#Reports">Recommendation Track process</a> that is not in an <a href="#tr-end-state">end state</a>, at least every three months the group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> publish a new draft of at least one of them on the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/">W3C technical reports page</a> [<a href="#ref-doc-list">PUB11</a>]. Each Working Group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> publish a new draft of each active technical
report at least every three months.</p>

<p>In exceptional cases, the Chair <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> ask the
Director to be excused from this publication requirement. However, in this
case, the Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> issue a public status
report with rationale why a new draft has not been published.</p>

<p>There are several reasons for this Working Group "heartbeat"
requirement:</p>

<ul>
<li>To promote public accountability;</li>

<li>To encourage Working Groups to keep moving forward, and to incorporate
their decisions into readable public documents. People cannot be expected to
read several months of a group's mailing list archive to understand where the
group stands;</li>

<li>To notify interested parties of updated work in familiar a place such as
the W3C home page and list of technical reports.</li>
</ul>

<h4>6.2.8 <a id="GeneralTermination" name="GeneralTermination">Working Group
and Interest Group Closure</a></h4>

<p>A Working Group or Interest Group charter specifies a duration for the
group. The Director, subject to <a href="#ACAppeal">appeal</a> by Advisory
Committee representatives, <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> close a group prior
to the date specified in the charter in any of the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
<li>There are insufficient resources to produce chartered deliverables or to
maintain the group, according to priorities established within W3C.</li>

<li>The group produces chartered deliverables ahead of schedule.</li>

<li>The Activity to which the group belongs terminates.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Director closes a Working Group or Interest Group by announcement to the
Advisory Committee.</p>

<h3>6.3 <a id="GroupsCG" name="GroupsCG">Coordination Groups</a></h3>

<p>W3C Activities interact in many ways. There are dependencies between groups
within the same Activity or in different Activities. There are also
dependencies between W3C Activities and the activities of other organizations.
Examples of dependencies include the use by one technology of another being
developed elsewhere, scheduling constraints between groups, and the
synchronization of publicity for the announcement of deliverables. Coordination
Groups are created to manage dependencies so that issues are resolved fairly
and the solutions are consistent with W3C's mission and results.</p>

<p>Where a Coordination Group's scope covers two groups with unresolved
disputes or tensions, it is the first locus of resolution of these
disputes.</p>

<h4>6.3.1 <a id="CGParticipation" name="CGParticipation">Coordination Group
Participation Requirements</a></h4>

<p>There are four types <a id="cgparticipant" name="cgparticipant">participants
in a Coordination Group</a>: the <a href="#GeneralChairs">Chair</a>, the Chair
of each coordinated group (to promote effective communication among the
groups), invited experts (e.g., liaisons to groups inside or outside W3C), and
Team representatives (including the <a href="#TeamContact">Team Contact</a>).
The requirements for invited expert participation are the same as for an <a href="#invited-expert-wg">invited expert in a Working Group</a>.</p>

<p>Coordination Group participants <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> follow the
<a href="#coi">conflict of interest policy</a> by disclosing information to the
rest of the group.</p>

<p>There are no Good Standing requirements for Coordination Group
participation; regular participation in a relevant Coordination Group is one of
the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Guide/chair-roles">roles of a group Chair [MEM14]</a>.</p>

<h4>6.3.2 <a id="CGCreation" name="CGCreation">Coordination Group Creation and
Closure</a></h4>

<p>The Director creates or modifies a Coordination Group by sending the <a href="#CGCharter">Coordination Group charter</a> to the Advisory Committee. A
Coordination Group <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> be created as part of an <a href="#ActivityProposal">Activity Proposal</a> (for example to coordinate other
groups in the Activity or to draw up charters of future groups), or during the
life of an Activity when dependencies arise. A Coordination Group <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> operate as part of several W3C Activities.</p>

<p>A Coordination Group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> close when there is
no longer a perceived need for coordination.</p>

<h4>6.3.3 <a id="CGCharter" name="CGCharter">Coordination Group
Charters</a></h4>

<p>A Coordination Group charter <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> include all
of the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li>The group's mission;</li>

<li>The scope of the group's work, including the names of coordinated groups
and contact information for those groups;</li>

<li>Any dependencies by groups within or outside of W3C on this group;</li>

<li>Any dependencies of this group on other groups within or outside of W3C;
see the section on <a href="#Liaisons">liaisons with other
organizations</a>.</li>

<li>The <a href="#confidentiality-levels">level of confidentiality</a> of the

<li>IPR disclosure requirements (see <a href="#ipr">W3C's IPR policy</a>);</li>

<li>Meeting mechanisms and expected frequency;</li>

<li>Communication mechanisms to be employed within the group, between the group
and the rest of W3C, and with the general public;</li>

<li>An estimate of the expected time commitment from participants;</li>

<li>The expected level of involvement by the Team.</li>
</ul>

<p>A charter <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> include additional voting

<h2>7 <a id="Reports" name="Reports">W3C Recommendation Track Process</a><a id="Recs" name="Recs"></a></h2>

<p>The Recommendation Track process is the set of steps and requirements
followed by W3C <a href="#GroupsWG">Working Groups</a> to standardize Web
technology. The processes followed by a Working Group to manage specifications
and guidelines -- called technical reports in this section -- include:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#rec-advance">Advancing a technical report</a> from early draft to
mature deliverable ("Recommendation"). <strong>Note:</strong> People use the
phrase "on the Recommendation Track" to refer to the process of advancing a
technical report to Recommendation. In this document, the phrase
"Recommendation Track process" refers to the larger set of requirements and
maturity levels described in the following bullets;</li>

<li><a href="#tr-end">Ending work on a technical report</a> before it reaches
Recommendation, or when not intended to become a Recommendation;</li>

<li><a href="#rec-modify">Modifying a W3C Recommendation</a>;</li>

<li><a href="#rec-rescind">Rescinding a Recommendation</a> no longer endorsed
by W3C;</li>
</ul>

<p>The W3C Recommendation Track process is designed to maximize <a href="#def-Consensus" rel="glossary" title="Definition of Consensus"><span class="dfn-instance">consensus</span></a> about the content of a technical
report, to ensure high technical and editorial quality, and to earn endorsement
by W3C and the broader community.</p>

<p>The following sections describe:</p>

<ul>
<li>the steps of the Recommendation Track process (e.g., "Announcement of Last
Call" or "Call for Implementations"),</li>

<li>the requirements for each step, and</li>

<li>the <a href="#maturity-levels">maturity level</a> of a technical report at
each step (e.g., "Working Draft" or "Candidate Recommendation"). Please note
that there is not a one-to-one correspondence between steps of the
Recommendation Track process and maturity levels.</li>
</ul>

<p>Maturity levels are described first, followed by the steps on the
Recommendation Track and the requirements for each step.</p>

<h3>7.1 <a id="maturity-levels" name="maturity-levels">Recommendation Track
Process Maturity Levels</a></h3>

<p>The maturity level of a published technical report indicates its place in
the Recommendation Track process. The maturity levels "Working Draft" and
"Working Group Note" represent the possible <a id="tr-init-state" name="tr-init-state">initial states</a> of a technical report in the
Recommendation Track process. The maturity levels "Recommendation", "Working

<h3>7.2 <a id="transition-reqs" name="transition-reqs">General Requirements for
Advancement</a></h3>

<p>A Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> fulfill certain
requirements in order to qualify for each <a href="#rec-advance">step towards
Recommendation</a>.</p>

<p>For publication of first public Working Draft up to but not including
publication as a Recommendation, the Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> record the group's decision to request
advancement.</p>

<p>For a Last Call announcement up to and including publication as a
Recommendation, the Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Indicate whether the document has been modified substantively since the
previous step. A <a id="substantive-change" name="substantive-change">substantive change</a> (whether deletion, inclusion,
or other modification) is one where someone could reasonably expect that making
the change would invalidate an individual's review or implementation
experience. Other changes (e.g., clarifications, bug fixes, editorial repairs,
and minor error corrections) are <a id="minor-change" name="minor-change">minor
changes</a>. A Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> document changes
(both substantive and minor) between steps.</li>

<li>Fulfill the relevant requirements of the Working Group charter and those of
any accompanying requirements documents, or report which relevant requirements
have not been fulfilled. For relevant requirements that have not been
fulfilled, the Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> provide
rationale to the satisfaction of the Director.</li>

<li>Indicate which dependencies with other groups the Working Group believes it
has satisfied, and report which dependencies have not been satisfied.</li>

<li>Show evidence of wide review.</li>

<li><a href="#formal-address">Formally address</a> all issues raised about the
document since the previous step. In practice, once a Working Group wishes to
advance to Candidate Recommendation or beyond, the Director expects positive
documentation that issues have been formally addressed (e.g., in an issues list
that shows their disposition). For earlier stages on the Recommendation Track,
less formal documentation generally suffices (e.g., evidence in an archived
mailing list).</li>

<li>Indicate any <a href="#WGArchiveMinorityViews">formal objections</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The following information is important to the decision to advance a
technical report and therefore <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be <a href="#confidentiality-change">publicly available</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Details of changes if the technical report has been modified substantively
since the previous step (e.g., by providing "diffs" and summaries of important
changes);</li>

<li>A statement that requirements have been fulfilled or a listing of
unfulfilled requirements and the rationale for advancing the document though
some requirements have not been met.</li>

<li>Evidence of wide review and that dependencies with other groups have been
resolved;</li>

<li>Responses that <a href="#formal-address">formally address issues</a> raised
by reviewers;</li>

<li>Any <a href="#WGArchiveMinorityViews">formal objections</a>;</li>
</ul>

<h3>7.3 <a id="doc-reviews" name="doc-reviews">Reviews and Review
Responsibilities</a></h3>

<p>Experience shows that the following help build consensus around technical
reports:</p>

<ol>
<li>Frequent publication (see the <a href="#three-month-rule">three-month
rule</a>).</li>

<li>Early review, to find errors quickly and decrease the chances of diverging
technologies.</li>

<li>Wide review, including from other groups in and outside of W3C.</li>
</ol>

<p>A document receives review from the moment it is first published. Starting
with the first publication through the end of a Proposed Recommendation review,
a Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> <a href="#formal-address">formally address</a> <em>any</em> substantive review
comment about a technical report and <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> do so
in a timely manner. However, reviewers <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD NOT</span>
send substantive technical reviews late on the Recommendation track. Reviewers
<span class="rfc2119">SHOULD NOT</span> expect that a Working Group will
readily make <a href="#substantive-change">substantive changes</a> to a mature
document. The more evidence a Working Group can show of wide review, the less
weight substantive comments will carry when provided late on the Recommendation
Track. Worthy ideas <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD BE</span> recorded even when
not incorporated into a mature document.</p>

<p>The Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be able to show evidence
of having attempted to respond to and satisfy reviewers. Reviewers <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> register a <a href="#WGArchiveMinorityViews">formal
objection</a> any time they are dissatisfied with how a Working Group has
handled an issue.</p>

<p>A Working Group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> negotiate review
schedules with other groups expected to review a document, including relevant
<a href="#Liaisons">liaisons</a>.</p>

<p>There are two formal review periods with fixed durations when advancing to
Recommendation: after a Last Call announcement and after a Call for Review of a
Proposed Recommendation. Out of consideration for the Working Group, reviewers
<span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> send their comments early in a review
period. A Working Group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD NOT</span> start a new
review before the scheduled end of an ongoing review (e.g., do not start a new
Last Call review before the scheduled end of an ongoing Last Call review).</p>

<p>Ordinarily, reviewers <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD NOT</span> raise
substantive technical issues about a technical report after the end of a Last
Call review period. However, this does occur, and as stated above, a Working
Group's requirement to formally address those issues extends until the end of a
Proposed Recommendation review period. However, to allow the Working Group to
make progress on a technical report, the Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> decline to make substantive changes to address
issues raised between the end of a Last Call review period and publication of a
Recommendation. A reviewer <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> register a <a href="#WGArchiveMinorityViews">formal objection</a>.</p>

<p>Advisory Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD NOT</span>
(but <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>) raise new substantive technical issues
during a Proposed Recommendation review period. The Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> respond to the reviewer after the close of the
Proposed Recommendation review period. <strong>Note:</strong> It may be
necessary to <a href="#confidentiality-change">change confidentiality level</a>
when conveying issues raised by Advisory Committee representatives to the
Working Group.</p>

<p>During review by the Members, the Working Group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> also <a href="#formal-address">formally
address</a> informed and relevant issues raised outside the Advisory Committee
(e.g., by the public or another W3C Working Group), and report them to the
Director in a timely fashion.</p>

<p>When a Working Group receives a substantive issue after the end of Proposed
Recommendation review period, the Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> respond to the reviewer but <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> decline to <a href="#formal-address">formally
address</a> the issue. In this case, the Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> consider the issue as part of tracking <a href="#errata">errata</a>.</p>

<h3>7.4 <a id="rec-advance" name="rec-advance">Advancing a Technical Report to
Recommendation</a></h3>

<p>W3C follows these steps when advancing a technical report to
Recommendation.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="#first-wd">Publication of the first public Working Draft</a>.</li>

<li><a href="#last-call">Last Call announcement</a></li>

<li><a href="#cfi">Call for Implementations</a>. <strong>Note:</strong> The
Director <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> permit the Working Group to skip this
step if the entrance criteria for the next step have already been
satisfied.</li>

<li><a href="#cfr">Call for Review of a Proposed Recommendation</a>.</li>

<li><a href="#rec-publication">Publication as a Recommendation</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>In general, Working Groups embark on this journey with the intent of
publishing one or more Recommendations. However, W3C <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> <a href="#tr-end">end work on a technical report</a>
at any time, or <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> require a Working Group to
conduct <a href="#return-to-wg">further work</a>, possibly repeating one or
more steps.</p>

<p>Between publication of the first public Working Draft and Last Call
announcement, a Working Group publishes revisions that generally include
substantive changes. Between any two steps after a Last Call announcement, the
Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> publish a new draft of the
technical report at the same maturity level provided there are no <a href="#substantive-change">substantive changes</a> since the earlier step.</p>

<p>The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> notify the <a href="#AC">Advisory
Committee</a> and other W3C groups of a revision to a Candidate Recommendation
or Proposed Recommendation.</p>

<p>These steps of the Recommendation Track process can take considerable time,
so participants are encouraged to read the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/05/rec-tips">tips on getting to Recommendation
faster</a> [<a href="#ref-rec-tips">PUB27</a>].</p>

<p>Refer to <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/Transitions">"How to Organize a Recommendation
Track Transition"</a> in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Guide/">Member
Guide</a> for practical information about preparing for the reviews and
announcements of the various steps.</p>

<h4>7.4.1 <a id="first-wd" name="first-wd">First Public Working Draft</a></h4>

<p>Document maturity level: <a href="#RecsWD">Working Draft</a>.</p>

<p>Announcement: The Director <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> announce the
first Working Draft publication to other W3C groups and to the public.</p>

<p>Purpose: The publication of the first public Working Draft is a signal to
the community to begin reviewing the document.</p>

<p>Entrance criteria: Director approval is <span class="rfc2119">REQUIRED</span> in order for a Working Group to publish a first
public Working Draft (or version for review beyond the membership, e.g., if
another organization has been asked to review a draft that is not yet
public).</p>

<p>Ongoing work: Once a Working Draft has been published, the Working Group
continues to publish revisions; see the <a href="#three-month-rule">three-month
rule</a>.</p>

<p>In order to make Working Drafts available to a wide audience early in their
development, the requirements for publication of a Working Draft are limited to
an agreement by a chartered Working Group to publish the technical report and
satisfaction of the Team's <a href="http://www.w3.org/Guide/pubrules">Publication Rules</a> [<a href="#ref-pubrules">PUB31</a>]. Consensus is not a prerequisite for approval
to publish; the Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> request
publication of a Working Draft even if it is unstable and does not meet all
Working Group requirements.</p>

<p>Working Groups <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> encourage early and wide
review of the technical report, within and outside of W3C, especially from
other Working Groups with dependencies on the technical report. Advisory
Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> encourage review
within their organizations as early as first public Working Draft, i.e., before
a <a href="#last-call">Last Call announcement</a> and <em>well before</em> a <a href="#cfr">Call for Review of a Proposed Recommendation</a>.</p>

<p>The Working Group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> be responsive to and
facilitate ongoing review by addressing issues in a timely manner and clearly
indicating changes between drafts (e.g., by providing "diffs" and summaries of
important changes).</p>

<p>Possible next steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Forward: <a href="#last-call">Last Call announcement</a></li>

<li>Otherwise: <a href="#tr-end">End Work</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>7.4.2 <a id="last-call" name="last-call">Last Call Announcement</a></h4>

<p>Document maturity level: <a href="#RecsWD">Working Draft</a>.</p>

<p>Announcement: The Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> announce
the Last Call to other W3C groups and to the public.</p>

<p>Purpose: A Working Group's Last Call announcement is a signal that:</p>

<ul>
<li>the Working Group believes that it has satisfied its relevant technical
requirements (e.g., of the charter or requirements document) in the Working
Draft;</li>

<li>the Working Group believes that it has satisfied significant dependencies
with other groups;</li>

<li>other groups <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> review the document to
confirm that these dependencies have been satisfied.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, a Last Call announcement is also a signal that the Working Group
is planning to advance the technical report to later maturity levels.</p>

<p>A Working Group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> work with other groups
prior to a Last Call announcement to reduce the risk of surprise at Last
Call.</p>

<p>Ideally, after a Last Call announcement, a Working Group receives only
indications of support for the document, with no proposals for substantive
change. In practice, Last Call announcements generate comments that sometimes
result in substantive changes to a document. A Working Group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD NOT</span> assume that it has finished its work by
virtue of issuing a Last Call announcement.</p>

<p>Entrance criteria: Before announcing a Last Call, the Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> have fulfilled the <a href="#transition-reqs">general requirements for advancement</a>.</p>

<p>A Last Call announcement <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>:</p>

<ol>
<li>specify the deadline for review comments;</li>

<li>identify known dependencies and solicit review from all dependent Working
Groups;</li>

<li>solicit public review.</li>
</ol>

<p>Duration of the review: The announcement begins a review period that <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> last at least <span class="time-interval">three
weeks</span> but <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> last longer if the technical
report is complex or has significant external dependencies.</p>

<p>Ongoing work: During the review period, the Working Group solicits and
responds to comments from the Team, the Members, other W3C groups, and the
public.</p>

<p>It is important to ensure the proper integration of a technical report in
the international community. Starting at this step in the Recommendation
process, the technical report <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> include a
statement about how the technology relates to existing international standards
and to related work outside of W3C.</p>

<p>Possible next steps:</p>

<h4>7.4.3 <a id="cfi" name="cfi">Call for Implementations</a></h4>

<p>Document maturity level: <a href="#RecsCR">Candidate Recommendation</a>.</p>

<p>Announcement: The Director <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> announce the
Call for Implementations to the <a href="#AC">Advisory Committee</a>.</p>

<p>Purpose: At this step, W3C believes the technical report is stable and
appropriate for implementation. The technical report <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> still change based on implementation experience.</p>

<p>Entrance criteria: The Director calls for implementation when satisfied that
the Working Group has fulfilled the <a href="#transition-reqs">general
requirements for advancement</a>.</p>

<p>The Working Group is <span class="rfc2119">NOT REQUIRED</span> to show that
a technical report has two independent and interoperable implementations as
part of a request to the Director to announce a Call for Implementations.
However, the Working Group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> include a report
of present and expected implementations as part of the request.</p>

<p>In the Call for Implementations, the Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> identify specific features of the technical report
as being "<a id="at-risk-feature" name="at-risk-feature">features at risk</a>."
General statements such as "We plan to remove any unimplemented feature" are
not acceptable; the Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> precisely
identify any features at risk. Thus, in response to a Call for Implementations,
reviewers can indicate whether they would <a href="#WGArchiveMinorityViews">formally object</a> to the removal of the
identified features.</p>

<p>After gathering implementation experience, the Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> remove features from the technical report that were
identified as being "at risk" and request that the Director <a href="#cfr">Call
for Review of a Proposed Recommendation</a>. If the Working Group makes other
<a href="#substantive-change">substantive changes</a> to the technical report,
the Director <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> return it to the Working Group
for <a href="#return-to-wg">further work</a>.</p>

<p>The request to the Director to advance a technical report to Candidate
Recommendation <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> indicate whether the Working
Group expects to satisfy any Proposed Recommendation entrance criteria beyond
the default requirements (described below).</p>

<p>Advisory Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> <a href="#ACAppeal">appeal</a> the decision to advance the technical report.</p>

<p>Duration of the implementation period: The announcement <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> indicate a minimal duration, before which the
Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> request a <a href="#cfr">Call for Review of a Proposed Recommendation</a>; this minimal
duration is designed to allow time for comment. The announcement <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> also include the Working Group's estimate of the
time expected to gather sufficient implementation data.</p>

<p>Possible next steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Forward: <a href="#cfr">Call for Review of a Proposed

<p>Purpose: At this step, W3C seeks endorsement of the stable technical report.
The outcome of this review is taken as an indication of the organization's
support for the technical report.</p>

<p>Entrance criteria: The Director calls for review when satisfied that the
Working Group has:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fulfilled the <a href="#transition-reqs">general requirements for
advancement</a>;</li>

<li>Shown that each feature of the technical report has been implemented.
Preferably, the Working Group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> be able to
demonstrate two interoperable implementations of each feature. If the Director
believes that immediate Advisory Committee Review is critical to the success of
a technical report, the Director <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> accept to
Call for Review of a Proposed Recommendation even without adequate
implementation experience;</li>

<li>Satisfied any other announced entrance criteria (e.g., any included in the
request to advance to Candidate Recommendation, or announced at Last Call if
the Working Group does not intend to issue a Call for Implementations).</li>
</ol>

<p>Advisory Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> <a href="#ACAppeal">appeal</a> the decision to advance the technical report.</p>

<p>Duration of the review: The announcement begins a review period that <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> last at least <span class="time-interval">four
weeks</span>.</p>

<p>Ongoing work: During the review period, the Working Group requests
endorsement and support from Members (e.g., testimonials as part of a press
release).</p>

<p>Possible next steps:</p>

<p>Document maturity level: <a href="#RecsW3C">Recommendation</a>.</p>

<p>Announcement: The Director <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> announce the
publication of a W3C Recommendation to the <a href="#AC">Advisory
Committee</a>.</p>

<p>Purpose: W3C publishes Recommendations when it believes that the ideas in
the technical report are appropriate for widespread deployment and that they
promote <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/">W3C's mission</a>.</p>

<p>Entrance criteria: The Director publishes a W3C Recommendation when
satisfied that there is significant support for the technical report from the
Advisory Committee, the Team, W3C Working Groups, and the public. The decision
to advance a document to Recommendation is a <a href="#def-w3c-decision" rel="glossary" title="Definition of W3C decision"><span class="dfn-instance">W3C decision</span></a>.</p>

<p>If there was any <a href="#def-Dissent" rel="glossary" title="Definition of Dissent"><span class="dfn-instance">dissent</span></a>
during the Member review, Advisory Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> <a href="#ACAppeal">appeal</a> the decision to

another standards body for adoption and formal approval by that body.</p>

<h4>7.4.6 <a id="return-to-wg" name="return-to-wg">Returning a Document to a
Working Group for Further Work</a></h4>

<p>A technical report is returned to a Working Group for further work in either
of the following situations:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Working Group makes <a href="#substantive-change">substantive
changes</a> to the technical report at any time after a <a href="#last-call">Last Call announcement</a> and prior to <a href="#rec-publication">Publication as a Recommendation</a>,
<strong>except</strong> when the changes involve the removal of <a href="#at-risk-feature">features at risk</a> identified in a <a href="#cfi">Call for Implementations</a>. In the case of substantive changes,
the Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> republish the technical
report as a Working Draft.</li>

<li>The Director requires the Working Group to address important issues raised
during a review or as the result of implementation experience. In this case,
Director <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> request that the Working Group
republish the technical report as a Working Draft, even if the Working Group
has not made <a href="#substantive-change">substantive changes</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Director <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> inform the <a href="#AC">Advisory Committee</a> and group Chairs when a technical report has
been returned to a Working Group for further work.</p>

<p>After republication as a Working Draft, the next forward step available to
the Working Group is a <a href="#last-call">Last Call announcement</a>. The
Last Call announcement <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> occur at the same time
as the publication of the Working Draft.</p>

<p>The Director <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> ask the Working Group to
republish a technical report as a Candidate Recommendation. At the same time as
publication, the Director issues a <a href="#cfi">Call for
Implementations</a>.</p>

<h3>7.5 <a id="tr-end" name="tr-end">Ending Work on a Technical Report</a></h3>

<p>Work on a technical report <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> cease at any
time. When a Working Group completes its work on a technical report, it
publishes it either as a Recommendation or a Working Group Note. For example, a
Working Group might publish several Working Drafts of a requirements document,
and then indicate that it no longer plans to work on the requirements document
by publishing a Working Group Note.</p>

<p>Work <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> also cease because W3C determines that
it cannot productively carry the work any further. For instance, the Director
might <a href="#GeneralTermination">close a Working Group</a>, the participants
might lose interest in a technical report, or the ideas might be subsumed by
another technical report. If W3C decides to discontinue work on a technical
report before completion, the technical report <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> be published as a Working Group Note.</p>

<p>Possible next steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>End state: A technical report <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> remain a
Working Group Note indefinitely</li>

<li>Otherwise: A Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> resume work on
the technical report as a Working Draft</li>
</ul>

<h3>7.6 <a id="rec-modify" name="rec-modify">Modifying a W3C
Recommendation</a></h3>

<p>W3C makes every effort to maintain its Recommendations (e.g., by tracking
errata, providing testbed applications, and helping to create test suites) and
to encourage widespread implementation. The following sections discuss the
management of errors and the process for making normative changes to a
Recommendation.</p>

<h4>7.6.1 <a id="errata" name="errata">Errata Management</a></h4>

<p>Tracking errors is an important part of a Working Group's ongoing care of a
Recommendation; for this reason, the scope of a Working Group charter generally
allows time for work after publication of a Recommendation. In this Process
Document, the term "erratum" (plural "errata") refers to any class of mistake,
from mere editorial to a serious error that may affect the conformance with the
Recommendation by software or content (e.g., content validity).
<strong>Note:</strong> Before a document becomes a Recommendation, an important
change is called a <a href="#substantive-change">substantive change</a> and
relates to the impact of the change on earlier review. After a document has
been published as Recommendation, an important change is one that relates to
the conformance of content or deployed software.</p>

<p>Working Groups <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> track errata on an "errata
page." An errata page is a list of enumerated errors, possibly accompanied by
corrections. Each Recommendation links to an errata page; see the Team's <a href="http://www.w3.org/Guide/pubrules">Publication Rules</a>.</p>

<p>A correction is first "proposed" by the Working Group. A correction becomes
normative -- of equal status as the text in the published Recommendation --
through one of the processes described below. An errata page <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> include both proposed and normative corrections. The
Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> clearly identify which
corrections are proposed and which are normative.</p>

<p>A Working Group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> keep their errata pages
up-to-date, as errors are reported by readers and implementers. A Working Group
<span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> report errata page changes to interested
parties, notably when corrections are proposed or become normative, according
to the Team's requirements. For instance, the Team might set up a mailing list
per Recommendation where a Working Group reports changes to an errata page.</p>

<h4>7.6.2 <a id="correction-classes" name="correction-classes">Classes of
Changes to a Recommendation</a></h4>

<p>This document distinguishes the following classes of changes to a
Recommendation.</p>

<dl><dt>1. No changes to text content</dt><dd>These changes include fixing broken links or invalid markup.</dd><dt>2. Corrections that do not affect conformance</dt><dd>Editorial changes or clarifications that do not change the technical
content of the specification.</dd><dt>3. Corrections that <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> affect conformance,
but add no new features</dt><dd>These changes <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> affect conformance to the
Recommendation. A change that affects conformance is one that: 

<ol>
<li>turns conforming data, processors, or other conforming agents into
non-conforming agents, or</li>

<li>turns non-conforming agents into conforming ones, or</li>

<li>clears up an ambiguity or underspecified part of the specification in such
a way that an agent whose conformance was once unclear becomes clearly
conforming or non-conforming.</li>
</ol>
</dd><dt>4. New features</dt><dd>For new features, W3C follows the full process of <a href="#rec-advance">advancing a technical report to Recommendation</a>.</dd></dl>

<p>The first two classes of change require no technical review of the proposed
changes, although a Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> call for
review. The modified Recommendation is published according to the Team's
requirements, including <a href="http://www.w3.org/Guide/pubrules">Publication
Rules</a> [<a href="#ref-pubrules">PUB31</a>].</p>

<p>For the third class of change, W3C requires:</p>

<ol>
<li>Review by the community to ensure the technical soundness of proposed
corrections.</li>

<li>Timely publication of the edited Recommendation, with corrections
incorporated.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the third class of change, the Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> either:</p>

<ol>
<li>Request that the Director issue a <a href="#cfr-edited">Call for Review of
an Edited Recommendation</a>, or</li>

<li>Issue a <a href="#cfr-corrections">Call for Review of Proposed
Corrections</a> that have not been incorporated into an edited draft (e.g.,
those listed on an errata page). After this review, the Director <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> announce that the proposed corrections are
normative.</li>
</ol>

<p>While the second approach is designed so that a Working Group can establish
normative corrections quickly, it does not obviate the need to incorporate
changes into an edited version of the Recommendation. In particular, when
corrections are numerous or complex, integrating them into a single document is
important for interoperability; readers might otherwise interpret the
corrections differently.</p>

<h4>7.6.3 <a id="cfr-edited" name="cfr-edited">Call for Review of an Edited
Recommendation</a></h4>

<p>Document maturity level: <a href="#ProposedEditedRec">Proposed Edited
Recommendation</a>.</p>

<p>Announcement: The Director <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> announce the
call for review to other W3C groups, the public, and the <a href="#AC">Advisory
Committee</a>.</p>

<p>Purpose: At this step, W3C seeks confirmation of proposed corrections to a
Recommendation.</p>

<p>Entrance criteria: The Director calls for review when satisfied that, with
respect to changes to the document, the Working Group has fulfilled the same
entrance criteria as for a <a href="#cfr">Call for Review of a Proposed
Recommendation</a> (e.g., the Working Group can show implementation experience
that supports the changes). In the request to advance to this status, the
Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> report any substantive issues
about the technical report that have not been resolved.</p>

<p>The announcement <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> fulfill the same
requirements as a <a href="#last-call">Last Call announcement</a> and <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> clearly indicate that this is a proposal to edit a
Recommendation.</p>

<p>Advisory Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> <a href="#ACAppeal">appeal</a> the decision to advance the technical report.</p>

<p>Duration of the review: The announcement begins a review period that <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> last at least <span class="time-interval">four
weeks</span>.</p>

<p>Ongoing work: Same as for a <a href="#last-call">Last Call review</a>.</p>

<p>Possible next steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Forward: <a href="#rec-publication">Publication of a W3C

<li>Otherwise, the Recommendation remains unchanged and two steps are possible:
<a href="#return-to-wg">Return to Working Group</a> or <a href="#tr-end">End

</ul>

<h4>7.6.4 <a id="cfr-corrections" name="cfr-corrections">Call for Review of
Proposed Corrections</a></h4>

<p>Document maturity level: A Recommendation, plus a list of proposed
corrections. The Working Group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> also include
a detailed description of how the Working Group plans to change the text of the
Recommendation for each proposed correction.</p>

<p>Announcement: The Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> announce
the call for review to other W3C groups, the public, and the <a href="#AC">Advisory Committee</a>.</p>

<p>Purpose: At this step, W3C seeks confirmation of proposed corrections to a

<p>Entrance criteria: The Working Group calls for review when, with respect to
changes to the document, the group has fulfilled the same entrance criteria as
for a <a href="#cfr">Call for Review of a Proposed Recommendation</a>.</p>

<p>The announcement <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> fulfill the same
requirements as a <a href="#last-call">Last Call announcement</a> and <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> clearly indicate that this is a proposal to make
normative corrections to the Recommendation.</p>

<p>Duration of the review: The announcement begins a review period that <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> last at least <span class="time-interval">four
weeks</span>.</p>

<p>Ongoing work: Same as for a <a href="#last-call">Last Call review</a>.</p>

<p>If there are no <a href="#WGArchiveMinorityViews">formal objections</a> to
the proposed corrections, W3C considers them normative. The Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> report formal objections to the Director, who
assesses whether there is sufficient consensus to declare the proposed
corrections to be normative.</p>

<p>Possible next steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Forward: <a href="#rec-publication">Publication of a W3C
Recommendation</a>. In order for the corrections to remain normative, the
Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> incorporate them into an edited
Recommendation. The Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> publish the
revised Recommendation within <span class="time-interval">six months</span>
after the end of the review or secure an extension from the Director. Prior to
publication, if the Working Group makes further changes to the technical report
that affect conformance, the Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
request a <a href="#cfr-edited">Call for Review of an Edited
Recommendation</a>.</li>

<li>Otherwise: The Recommendation remains unchanged and two steps are possible:
<a href="#return-to-wg">Return to Working Group</a> or <a href="#tr-end">End
Work</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>7.7 <a id="rec-rescind" name="rec-rescind">Rescinding a W3C
Recommendation</a></h3>

<p>At times, W3C <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> rescind an entire
Recommendation, for instance when W3C learns of significant errors in the
Recommendation, when the Recommendation becomes outdated, or if W3C discovers
burdensome patent claims that affect implementers.</p>

<p>To deprecate <em>part</em> of a Recommendation, W3C follows the process for
<a href="#rec-modify">modifying a Recommendation</a>.</p>

<p>Once W3C has published a Rescinded Recommendation, future W3C technical
reports <span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> include normative references to

<p>Entrance criteria: The Director publishes a Rescinded Recommendation when
satisfied that there is significant support from the Advisory Committee, the
Team, W3C Working Groups, and the public. The decision to advance a document to

<p>The Team <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> publish one or more documents in
order to best communicate what has been rescinded and its relation to previous
Recommendations (e.g., the publication can be as simple as a cover sheet that
refers to a previously published Recommendation).</p>

<p>If there was any <a href="#def-Dissent" rel="glossary" title="Definition of Dissent"><span class="dfn-instance">dissent</span></a> in

<h3>7.8 <a id="DocumentsGeneral" name="DocumentsGeneral">General Information
about Technical Reports</a></h3>

<p>Every document published as part of the Recommendation Track process <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be a public document. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/">list of W3C technical reports</a> [<a href="#ref-doc-list">PUB11</a>] is available at the W3C Web site. W3C will make
every effort to make archival documents indefinitely available at their
original address in their original form.</p>

<p>Every document published as part of the Recommendation Track process <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> clearly indicate its <a href="#maturity-levels">maturity level</a>.</p>

<p>Every technical report published as part of the Recommendation Track process
is edited by one or more editors appointed by a Working Group Chair. It is the
responsibility of these editors to ensure that the decisions of the group are
correctly reflected in subsequent drafts of the technical report. Editors are
<span class="rfc2119">NOT REQUIRED</span> to be part of the Team.</p>

<p>The Team is <span class="rfc2119">NOT REQUIRED</span> to publish a technical
report that does not conform to the Team's <a href="http://www.w3.org/Guide/pubrules">Publication Rules</a> (e.g., for <a id="DocumentName" name="DocumentName">naming</a>, style, and <a id="document-copyright" name="document-copyright">copyright requirements</a>).
These rules are subject to change. The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
inform group Chairs and the Advisory Board of any changes.</p>

<p>The Team reserves the right to reformat technical reports at any time so as
to conform to changes in W3C practice (e.g., changes to technical report styles
or the <a href="#DocumentStatus">document status section</a>).</p>

<p>The primary language for W3C technical reports is English. W3C encourages
the translation of its technical reports. <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation/">Information about translations

<h4>7.8.1 <a id="DocumentStatus" name="DocumentStatus">Document Status
Section</a></h4>

<p>Each technical report <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> include a section
about the status of the document. The status section <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> explain why W3C has published the technical
report, expectations about next steps, who developed it, where to send comments
about it, whether implementation experience is being sought, any significant
changes from the previous version, why work on the technical report has ceased

<h2>8 <a id="ReviewAppeal" name="ReviewAppeal">Advisory Committee Reviews,
Appeals, and Votes</a></h2>

<p>This section describes how the Advisory Committee reviews proposals from the
Director and how Advisory Committee representatives appeal W3C decisions and
decisions by the Director. A <a id="def-w3c-decision" name="def-w3c-decision"><dfn><b>W3C decision</b></dfn></a> is one where the
Director (or the Director's delegate) has exercised the role of assessing
consensus after an <a href="#ACReview">Advisory Committee Review</a> of an <a href="#ActivityProposal">Activity Proposal</a>, after a <a href="#cfr">Call for
Review of a Proposed Recommendation</a>, after a <a href="#proposed-rescinded-rec">Proposal to Rescind a W3C Recommendation</a>,
and after a <a href="#GAProcess">Proposed Process Document</a> review.</p>

<h3>8.1 <a id="ACReview" name="ACReview">Advisory Committee Reviews</a></h3>

<p>The Advisory Committee reviews:</p>

<ul>
<li>proposals for <a href="#ActivityCreation">new</a>, <a href="#ActivityModification">modified</a>, and <a href="#ActivityExtension">extended Activities</a>,</li>

<li><a href="#CharterReview">new and modified Working and Interest
Groups</a>,</li>

<li><a href="#cfr">Proposed Recommendations</a>, and</li>

<li><a href="#GAProcess">Proposed changes to the W3C process</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>8.1.1 <a id="ACReviewStart" name="ACReviewStart">Start of a Review
Period</a></h4>

<p>Each Advisory Committee Review period begins with a call for review from the
Team to the Advisory Committee. The <a id="reviewform" name="reviewform">review
form</a> in this announcement indicates:</p>

<ul>
<li>The nature of the proposal;</li>

<li>The end of the review period (i.e., the deadline for returned review
forms);</li>

<li>One or more email addresses where completed review forms are sent.</li>
</ul>

<p>The announcement <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> also estimate the
schedule of the entire review process, up to and including the decision (e.g.,
the deadline for review comments is on this date, and a decision is not likely
sooner than two weeks thereafter).</p>

<p>Each Member organization <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> send one review,
which <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be returned by its Advisory Committee
representative.</p>

<p>The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> provide two channels for Advisory
Committee Review comments:</p>

<ol>
<li>an archived <a href="#Team-only">Team-only</a> channel; this is the default
channel for reviews.</li>

<li>an archived <a href="#Member-only">Member-only</a> channel.</li>
</ol>

<p>Reviewers <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> send information to either or
both channels. They <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> also share their reviews
with other Members on the <a href="#ACCommunication">Advisory Committee
discussion list</a>.</p>

<p>A Member organization <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> modify its review
during a review period (e.g., in light of comments from other Members).</p>

<h4>8.1.2 <a id="ACReviewAfter" name="ACReviewAfter">After the Review
Period</a></h4>

<p>After the review period, the Director <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
announce to the Advisory Committee the level of support for the proposal (<a href="#def-Unanimity" rel="glossary" title="Definition of Unanimity"><span class="dfn-instance">unanimity</span></a>, <a href="#def-Consensus" rel="glossary" title="Definition of Consensus"><span class="dfn-instance">consensus</span></a>, or <a href="#def-Dissent" rel="glossary" title="Definition of Dissent"><span class="dfn-instance">dissent</span></a>). The Director <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> also indicate whether there were any documented
objections, with attention to <a href="#confidentiality-change">changing
confidentiality level</a>. This <a href="#def-w3c-decision" rel="glossary" title="Definition of W3C decision"><span class="dfn-instance">W3C
decision</span></a> is generally one of the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>The proposal is approved, possibly with <a href="#minor-change">minor
changes</a> integrated.</li>

<li>The proposal is approved, possibly with <a href="#substantive-change">substantive changes</a> integrated. In this case the
Director's announcement <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> include rationale for
the decision to advance the document despite the proposal for a substantive
change.</li>

<li>The proposal is returned for additional work, with a request to the
initiator to <a href="#formal-address">formally address</a> certain
issues.</li>

<li>The proposal is rejected.</li>
</ol>

<p>This document does not specify time intervals between the end of an Advisory
Committee Review period and the <a href="#def-w3c-decision" rel="glossary" title="Definition of W3C decision"><span class="dfn-instance">W3C
decision</span></a>. This is to ensure that the Members and Team have
sufficient time to consider comments gathered during the review. The Advisory
Committee <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD NOT</span> expect an announcement sooner
than <span class="time-interval">two weeks</span> after the end of a Proposed
Recommendation review period. If, after <span class="time-interval">three
weeks</span>, the Director has not announced the outcome, the Director <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> provide the Advisory Committee with an
update.</p>

<h3>8.2 <a id="ACAppeal" name="ACAppeal">Appeal by Advisory Committee
Representatives</a></h3>

<p>Advisory Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> appeal
certain decisions, though appeals are only expected to occur in extraordinary
circumstances.</p>

<p>When Advisory Committee review immediately precedes a decision, Advisory
Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> only appeal when
there is <a href="#def-Dissent" rel="glossary" title="Definition of Dissent"><span class="dfn-instance">dissent</span></a>.
These decisions are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#rec-publication">Publication of a Recommendation</a> or <a href="#publication-rescinded-rec">Publication of a Rescinded
Recommendation</a>,</li>

<li><a href="#ActivityProposal">Activity creation</a>, <a href="#ActivityModification">modification</a>, or <a href="#ActivityExtension">extension</a>,</li>

<li><a href="#cfp">Working or Interest Group creation</a> or <a href="#charter-extension">extension</a>,</li>

<li>Changes to the <a href="#GAProcess">W3C process</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Advisory Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> always
appeal the following decisions:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#ActivityTermination">Activity closure</a>,</li>

<li><a href="#charter-extension">Working or Interest Group extension</a> or <a href="#GeneralTermination">closure</a>,</li>

<li><a href="#cfi">Call for Implementations</a>, <a href="#cfr">Call for Review
of a Proposed Recommendation</a>, <a href="#cfr-edited">Call for Review of an
Edited Recommendation</a>, or <a href="#proposed-rescinded-rec">Proposal to
Rescind a Recommendation</a></li>

<li>the Director's intention to sign a <a href="#mou">Memorandum of
Understanding</a> with another organization.</li>
</ul>

<p>In all cases, an appeal <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be initiated
within <span class="time-interval">three weeks</span> of the decision.</p>

<p>An Advisory Committee representative initiates an appeal by sending a
request to the Team (explained in detail in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Member/Intro">New Member Orientation</a>). The Team
<span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> announce the appeal process to the Advisory
Committee and provide an address for comments from Advisory Committee
representatives. The archive of these comments <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be Member-visible. If, within <span class="time-interval">one week</span> of the Team's announcement, 5% or more of
the Advisory Committee support the appeal request, the Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> organize an appeal vote asking the Advisory
Committee to approve or reject the decision. 
<!-- Voting procedure to be determined -->
</p>

<h3>8.3 <a id="ACVotes" name="ACVotes">Advisory Committee Votes</a></h3>

<p>The Advisory Committee votes in <a href="#AB-TAG-elections">elections for
seats on the TAG or Advisory Board</a>, and in the event of a formal appeal of
a <a href="#def-w3c-decision" rel="glossary" title="Definition of W3C decision"><span class="dfn-instance">W3C
decision</span></a>. Whenever the Advisory Committee votes, each Member or
group of <a href="#MemberRelated">related Members</a> has one vote. In the case
of <a href="#AB-TAG-elections">Advisory Board and TAG elections</a>, "one vote"
means "one vote per available seat".</p>

<h2>9 <a id="GAEvents" name="GAEvents">Workshops and Symposia</a></h2>

<p>The Team organizes <a id="EventsW" name="EventsW">workshops</a> and <a id="EventsS" name="EventsS">symposia</a> to promote early involvement in the
development of W3C Activities from Members and the public.</p>

<p>The goal of a workshop is usually either to convene experts and other
interested parties for an exchange of ideas about a technology or policy, or to
address the pressing concerns of W3C Members. Organizers of the first type of
workshop <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> solicit position papers for the
workshop program and <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> use those papers to
choose attendees and/or presenters.</p>

<p>The goal of a symposium is usually to educate interested parties about a
particular subject.</p>

<p>The Call for Participation in a workshop or symposium <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> indicate participation requirements or limits, and
expected deliverables (e.g., reports and minutes). Organization of an event
does not guarantee further investment by W3C in a particular topic, but <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> lead to proposals for new Activities or groups.</p>

<p>Workshops and symposia generally last one to three days. If a workshop is
being organized to address the pressing concerns of Members, the Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> issue the Call for Participation no later than
<span class="time-interval">six weeks</span> prior to the workshop's scheduled
start date. For other workshops and symposia, the Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> issue a Call for Participation no later than <span class="time-interval">eight weeks</span> prior to the meeting's scheduled start
date. This helps ensure that speakers and authors have adequate time to prepare
position papers and talks.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> In general, W3C does not organize <a id="EventsC" name="EventsC">conferences</a>. Currently, W3C presents its work to the public
at the annual World Wide Web Conference, which is coordinated by the <a href="http://www.iw3c2.org/">International World Wide Web Conference
Committee</a> (<acronym>IW3C2</acronym>).</p>

<!-- #/block -->
<!-- #block liaisons -->
<!--NewPage-->
<!-- this is for html2ps -->
<h2>10 <a id="Liaisons" name="Liaisons">Liaisons</a></h2>

<p>W3C uses the term "liaison" to refer to coordination of activities with a
variety of organizations, through a number of mechanisms ranging from very
informal (e.g., an individual from another organization participates in a W3C
Working Group, or just follows its work) to mutual membership, to even more
formal agreements. <strong>Note:</strong> W3C is one party in a liaison; in the
remainder of this document, the term "Partner" refers to the other party.</p>

<p>The goals of formal liaison process described in this section are to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Enable both organizations to pursue related goals (e.g., technical
specifications) to their mutual benefit.</li>

<li>Facilitate development of complementary technologies, possibly resolving
mutual dependencies.</li>

<li>Document the commitment from both organizations, in resources and
principle, to pursuing work in a particular area.</li>

<li>Coordinate communication about the focus of the liaison.</li>

<li>Allow synchronization of schedules and calendars.</li>

<li>Ensure that technical progress can be made in a manner consistent with
W3C's <a href="#ipr">intellectual property rights policy</a>.</li>

<li>Prevent market fragmentation.</li>

<li>Provide for specific benefits (such as mutual membership) enumerated in the
liaison charter.</li>
</ol>

<p>This process is minimally constraining since, in practice, liaisons take a
variety of forms (e.g., the liaison involves W3C process more than the
Partner's process or vice-versa). The process consists of:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="#LiaisonCreation">Liaison creation and modification</a></li>

<li><a href="#LiaisonCharters">Liaison charters</a></li>

<li><a href="#LiaisonStatus">Liaison status reports</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Liaisons -- formal or informal -- <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be
coordinated by the Team due to requirements for public communication, IPR
policies, confidentiality agreements, and mutual membership agreements.</p>

<p>The W3C Director <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> negotiate and sign a <a id="mou" name="mou">Memorandum of Understanding (<acronym>MoU</acronym>)</a>
with another organization. However, before doing so, the Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> announce the intention to sign to the Advisory
Committee, who <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> <a href="#ACAppeal">appeal</a>.
A Memorandum of Understanding <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be made
available to Members and <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> be made public
after approval.</p>

<p>A list of <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/11/StdLiaison">W3C liaisons with
other organizations</a> [<a href="#ref-liaison-list">PUB28</a>] is available on
the Web.</p>

<h3>10.1 <a id="LiaisonCreation" name="LiaisonCreation">Formal Liaison Creation
and Modification</a></h3>

<p>The Director creates, modifies, or extends a formal liaison by announcement
to the Advisory Committee. The announcement <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
include a reference to the <a href="#LiaisonCharters">liaison charter</a>.
Advisory Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> <a href="#ACAppeal">appeal</a> the creation, modification, or extension of a
liaison.</p>

<p>Liaisons are not meant to substitute for W3C membership. The formal liaison
process is meant to improve coordination with similar (membership)
organizations. If an organization wishes to participate in W3C work, that
organization <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Prospectus/Joining">join W3C</a>.</p>

<h4><a id="q103" name="q103">10.1.1 Considerations in the Decision to Create a
Formal Liaison</a></h4>

<p>W3C's decision to pursue a liaison with a Partner is ultimately based on the
perceived costs and benefits to W3C. Important considerations include:</p>

<ol>
<li>Will both organizations make available to each other all information
pertinent to the joint effort?</li>

<li>Will both organizations ensure public distribution of intermediate and
final versions of technical reports?</li>

<li>Will both organizations respect the confidentiality of sensitive
information? Willingness by both parties to protect such information fosters
trust and may allow Working Groups to get work done more quickly. However,
those involved should not lose sight of the ultimate goal of open and public
specifications.</li>

<li>Will both organizations disclose any IPR claims related to the joint
effort? What happens when the Partner does not share the same IPR policy as
W3C? When it's more strict or more loose? Is disclosure the minimum? How will
the organization address patents as part of filling out the charter?</li>

<li>Will both organizations coordinate all public statements and press releases
related to the joint effort?</li>

<li>Will both organizations encourage peer review at appropriate/documented
milestones so as to ensure compatibility? Agree to negotiate changes deemed
necessary by reviewers? Agree to solicit and respond to comments made during
periods of public review?</li>

<li>Will both organizations reach decisions by consensus and document
objections when consensus is not possible?</li>

<li>Will Members of both organizations commit to representing the parent
organizations in work related to the joint effort?</li>

<li>What copyright and distribution policies will govern deliverables? Will the
publications be available according to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-documents">W3C Document
License</a> [<a href="#ref-doc-license">PUB18</a>]? Will software be available
according to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software">W3C Software
Notice and License</a> [<a href="#ref-software-license">PUB19</a>]?</li>
</ol>

<p>Reasons not to pursue a liaison with another organization include:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does the other organization have selective or arbitrary membership policies
that serve only to benefit pre-existing or dominant members?</li>
</ol>

<h3>10.2 <a id="LiaisonCharters" name="LiaisonCharters">Formal Liaison
Charters</a></h3>

<p>Each formal liaison has a public charter that <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> include all of the following information.</p>

<dl><dt>The organizations</dt><dd>
<ul>
<li>The names and contact information for both organizations.</li>

<li>The background of the relationship between W3C and the Partner. Why is this
liaison being proposed now? What is the market within the area of the proposal?
What organizations, products, or standards currently exists in the market? Is
the market mature/growing/developing a niche? What competing technologies
exist? Are there competing organizations?</li>

<li>The degree of involvement by one organization in the work of the other.
Will involvement be symmetric?</li>

<li>Whether mutual membership is part of this liaison. Do mutual memberships
include waiving dues? Will both organizations be permitted to send any number
of participants to work in various groups (subject to the limits of each
group's charter)?</li>

<li>Relation to other consortia and similar organizations. Do the Partner and
W3C share a similar relationship with other consortia, organizations, or
Members? Will both organizations try to encourage cross membership?</li>
</ul>
</dd><dt>The goals of the liaison</dt><dd>
<ul>
<li>The goals of the liaison (e.g., convergence of technologies, exchange of
information, development of new architecture).</li>

<li>The scope of the liaison (e.g., topics covered or not covered).</li>

<li>The technologies that will be the object of this work, and dependencies on
other technologies.</li>

<li>Deliverables expected as a result of the liaison.</li>

<li>Requirements from the Partner on the deliverables (e.g., IPR requirements
or expectations for the adoption of a particular specification).</li>
</ul>
</dd><dt>Process and policies</dt><dd>
<ul>
<li>The process that will govern the joint effort (e.g., will a document be
part of the W3C Recommendation Track process?).</li>

<li>Any dispute resolution processes.</li>

<li>The IPR policy will be associated with the deliverables. For example, will
the copyright on deliverables resulting from the joint effort be held jointly
by both organizations?</li>
</ul>
</dd><dt>Resources</dt><dd>
<ul>
<li>The W3C groups that will be involved in the liaison (e.g., within W3C,
which Working Group or Coordination Group).</li>

<li>The W3C Team Contact for the liaison and time allocated to tracking the
liaison.</li>

<li>The primary contact for the liaison organization and any other important
participant information.</li>
</ul>

<h3>10.3 <a id="LiaisonStatus" name="LiaisonStatus">Formal Liaison Status
Reports</a></h3>

<p>At least at each Advisory Committee meeting, the Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> present an update of each formal liaison that
describes the state of the liaison, goals achieved or not, and deliverables
produced or not. The update <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> highlight
significant changes, successes, and failures since the previous update. The
Team <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> also keep the <a href="#AB">Advisory
Board</a> regularly informed (e.g., once per quarter) of important events or
changes regarding liaisons.</p>

<h2>11 <a id="Submission" name="Submission">Member Submission Process</a></h2>

<p>The Member Submission process allows Members to propose technology or other
ideas for consideration by the Team. After review, the Team <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> publish the material at the W3C Web site. The formal
process affords Members a record of their contribution and gives them a
mechanism for disclosing the details of the transaction with the Team
(including <a href="#ipr">IPR claims</a>). The Team also publishes review
comments on the Submitted materials for W3C Members, the public, and the
media.</p>

<p>A <a id="MemberSubmission" name="MemberSubmission">Member Submission</a>
consists of:</p>

<ul>
<li>One or more documents developed outside of the W3C process, and</li>

<li>Information about the documents, provided by the Submitter.</li>
</ul>

<p>One or more Members (called the "Submitter(s)") <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> participate in a Member Submission. Only W3C Members
<span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> be listed as Submitter(s). For details about
preparing a Member Submission, see "<a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/submission">How to send a Submission
request</a>" [<a href="#ref-member-sub">MEM8</a>].</p>

<p>The Submission process consists of the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>One of the Submitter(s) sends a request to the Team to acknowledge the
Submission request. The Team and Submitter(s) communicate to ensure that the
Member Submission is complete.</li>

<li>After Team review, the Director <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> either
acknowledge or reject the Submission request. 

<ul>
<li>If <a href="#SubmissionYes">acknowledged</a>, the Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> publish the Member Submission at the public W3C Web
site, in addition to Team comments about the Member Submission.</li>

<li>If <a href="#SubmissionNo">rejected</a>, the Submitter(s) <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> appeal to either the <a href="#TAG">TAG</a> or the
<a href="#AB">Advisory Board</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> To avoid confusion about the Member Submission
process, please note that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Documents in a Member Submission are developed outside of W3C. These
documents are <strong>not</strong> part of the <a href="#Reports">Recommendation Track process</a> (and therefore are not
included in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/">list of W3C technical
reports</a>). Members wishing to have documents developed outside of W3C
published by W3C <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> follow the Member Submission
process.</li>

<li>The Submission process is <strong>not</strong> a means by which Members ask
for "ratification" of these documents as <a href="#RecsW3C">W3C
Recommendations</a>.</li>

<li>There is no requirement or guarantee that technology which is part of an
acknowledged Submission request will receive further consideration by W3C
(e.g., by a W3C Working Group).</li>
</ul>

<p>Publication of a Member Submission by W3C does not imply endorsement by W3C,
including the W3C Team or Members. The acknowledgment of a Submission request
does not imply that any action will be taken by W3C. It merely records publicly
that the Submission request has been made by the Submitter. A Member Submission
published by W3C <span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> be referred to as "work
in progress" of the W3C.</p>

<p>The list of <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/">acknowledged Member
Submissions</a> [<a href="#ref-submission-list">PUB10</a>] is available at the
W3C Web site.</p>

<h3>11.1 <a id="SubmissionRights" name="SubmissionRights">Submitter Rights and
Obligations</a></h3>

<p>When more than one Member jointly participates in a Submission request, only
one Member formally sends in the request. That Member <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> copy each of the Advisory Committee representatives
of the other participating Members, and each of those Advisory Committee
representatives <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> confirm (by email to the
Team) their participation in the Submission request.</p>

<p>At any time prior to acknowledgment, any Submitter <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> withdraw support for a Submission request (described
in "<a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/submission">How to send a Submission
request</a>"). A Submission request is "withdrawn" when no Submitter(s) support
it. The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> make statements about
withdrawn Submission requests.</p>

<p>Prior to acknowledgment, the Submitter(s) <span class="rfc2119">MUST
NOT</span>, <strong>under any circumstances</strong>, refer to a document as
"submitted to the World Wide Web Consortium" or "under consideration by W3C" or
any similar phrase either in public or Member communication. The Submitter(s)
<span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> imply in public or Member communication
that W3C is working (with the Submitter(s)) on the material in the Member
Submission. The Submitter(s) <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> publish the
documents in the Member Submission prior to acknowledgment (without reference
to the Submission request).</p>

<p>After acknowledgment, the Submitter(s) <span class="rfc2119">MUST
NOT</span>, <strong>under any circumstances</strong>, imply W3C investment in
the Member Submission until, and unless, the material has been adopted as part
of a W3C <a href="#def-Activity" rel="glossary" title="Definition of Activity"><span class="dfn-instance">Activity</span></a>.</p>

<p>The Submitter(s) <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> agree that, if the
request is acknowledged, the documents in the Member Submission will be subject
to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-documents">W3C
Document License</a> [<a href="#ref-doc-license">PUB18</a>] and will include a
reference to it. The Submitter(s) <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> hold the
copyright for the documents in a Member Submission.</p>

<h4>11.1.1 <a id="SubmissionScope" name="SubmissionScope">Scope of Member
Submissions</a></h4>

<p>When a technology overlaps in scope with the work of a chartered Working
Group, Members <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> <a href="#group-participation">participate in the Working Group</a> and contribute
the technology to the group's process rather than seek publication through the
Member Submission process. The Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
incorporate the contributed technology into its deliverables. If the Working
Group does not incorporate the technology, it <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD
NOT</span> publish the contributed documents as Working Group Notes since
Working Group Notes represent group output, not input to the group.</p>

<p>On the other hand, while W3C is in the early stages of developing an
Activity Proposal or charter, Members <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> use
the Submission process to build consensus around concrete proposals for new
work.</p>

<p>Members <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD NOT</span> submit materials covering
topics well outside the scope of <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/">W3C's
mission</a> [<a href="#ref-mission">PUB15</a>].</p>

<h3>11.2 <a id="TeamSubmissionRights" name="TeamSubmissionRights">Team Rights
and Obligations</a></h3>

<p>Although they are not technical reports, the documents in a Member
Submission <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> fulfill the requirements
established by the Team, including the Team's <a href="http://www.w3.org/Guide/pubrules">Publication Rules</a>.</p>

<p>The Team sends a <a id="validation-notice" name="validation-notice">validation notice</a> to the Submitter(s) once the
Team has reviewed a Submission request and judged it complete and correct.</p>

<p>Prior to a decision to <a href="#SubmissionYes">acknowledge</a> or <a href="#SubmissionNo">reject</a> the request, the request is <a href="#Team-only">Team-only</a>, and the Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
hold it in the strictest confidentiality. In particular, the Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> comment to the media about the Submission
request.</p>

<h3>11.3 <a id="SubmissionYes" name="SubmissionYes">Acknowledgment of a
Submission Request</a></h3>

<p>The Director <a href="#SubmissionYes">acknowledges</a> a Submission request
by sending an announcement to the Advisory Committee. Though the announcement
<span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> be made at any time, the Submitter(s) can
expect an announcement between <span class="time-interval">four to six
weeks</span> after the <a href="#validation-notice">validation notice</a>. The
Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> keep the Submitter(s) informed of when
an announcement is likely to be made.</p>

<p>Once a Submission request has been acknowledged, the Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Publish the Member Submission.</li>

<li>Publish Team comments about the Submission request.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the Submitter(s) wish to modify a document published as the result of
acknowledgment, the Submitter(s) <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> start the
Submission process from the beginning, even just to correct editorial
changes.</p>

<h3>11.4 <a id="SubmissionNo" name="SubmissionNo">Rejection of a Submission
Request</a></h3>

<p>The Director <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> reject a Submission request
for a variety of reasons, including any of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The ideas expressed in the request overlap in scope with the work of a
chartered Working Group, and acknowledgment might jeopardize the progress of
the group.</li>

<li>The IPR statement made by the Submitter(s) is too restrictive; (see <a href="#ipr">W3C's IPR policy</a>).</li>

<li>The ideas expressed in the request are poor, might harm the Web, or run
counter to <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/">W3C's mission</a>.</li>

<li>The ideas expressed in the request lie well outside the scope of W3C's
mission.</li>
</ul>

<p>In case of a rejection, the Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> inform
the Advisory Committee representative(s) of the Submitter(s). If requested by
the Submitter(s), the Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> provide rationale
to the Submitter(s) about the rejection. Other than to the Submitter(s), the
Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> make statements about why a
Submission request was rejected.</p>

<p>The Advisory Committee representative(s) of the Submitters(s) <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> appeal the rejection to the <a href="#TAG">TAG</a>
if the reasons are related to Web architecture, or to the <a href="#AB">Advisory Board</a> if the request is rejected for other reasons. In
this case the Team <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> make available its
rationale for the rejection to the appropriate body. The Team will establish a
process for such appeals that ensures the appropriate <a href="#confidentiality-levels">level of confidentiality</a>.</p>

<h2>12 <a id="GAProcess" name="GAProcess">Process Evolution</a></h2>

<p>The <a id="ProcessDoc" name="ProcessDoc">W3C Process Document</a> undergoes
similar consensus-building processes as documents that are part of the
Recommendation Track process, with the <a href="#AB">Advisory Board</a> acting
as the sponsoring Working Group.</p>

<p>The Advisory Board initiates review of a Process Document as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Chair of the Advisory Board sends a call for review to the Advisory
Committee and other W3C groups.</li>

<li>After comments have been <a href="#formal-address">formally addressed</a>
and the document possibly modified, the Team seeks endorsement from the Members
by initiating an <a href="#ACReview">Advisory Committee Review</a> of a
Proposed Process Document. The review period <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
last at least <span class="time-interval">four weeks</span>.</li>

<li><a href="#ACReviewAfter">After the Advisory Committee Review</a>, if there
is consensus, the Team enacts the new process officially by announcing the <a href="#def-w3c-decision" rel="glossary" title="Definition of W3C decision"><span class="dfn-instance">W3C
decision</span></a> to the Advisory Committee. If there was <a href="#def-Dissent" rel="glossary" title="Definition of Dissent"><span class="dfn-instance">dissent</span></a>, Advisory Committee representatives
<span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> <a href="#ACAppeal">appeal</a> the
decision.</li>
</ol>

<p>W3C <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> also modify a Process Document by
following the processes for <a href="#rec-modify">modifying a
Recommendation</a>.</p>

<p>Reviews of the Process Document are not public reviews.</p>
