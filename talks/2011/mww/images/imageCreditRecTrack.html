            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Working Draft</strong>: Working Drafts
                are published and announced specifically to ask
                for review and input from the community. Often
                there are issues that a Working Group would
                particularly like input on. Usually multiple
                Working Drafts of a technical report are
                published.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Last Call Working Draft</strong>: When a
                Working Group believes it has addressed all
                comments and technical requirements, it provides
                the complete document for community review and
                announces the Last Call.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Candidate Recommendation</strong>: The
                main purpose of Candidate Recommendation is to
                ensure that the technical report can be
                implemented. W3C encourages developers to use the
                technical report in their projects. The technical
                report is stable at this stage; however, it may
                change based on implementation experience.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Proposed Recommendation</strong>: After
                there are implementations of each feature of the
                technical report, W3C announces it as a Proposed
                Recommendation. At this stage, the report is
                submitted to the W3C Membership for endorsement.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>W3C Recommendation (Web
                Standard)</strong>: Once there is significant
                support for the technical report from the W3C
                Members, the W3C Director, and the public, it is
                published as a Recommendation. W3C encourages
                widespread deployment of its Recommendations.
