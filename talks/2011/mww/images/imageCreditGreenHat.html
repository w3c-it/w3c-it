        Explanation:

       <em>If you are a man, do not, under any circumstances, wear a green hat!</em><br />
			 There is an old story in China, about a <em>businessman</em>, a <em>tailor</em>, and the <em>businessman's wife</em>.<br />
       (You can guess where this is going&hellip;)  
			 Whenever the businessman left his village to go on a business trip, 
			 <em>his wife would cheat on him</em> with the village tailor.<br />  
			 To make it easier for the tailor to know when the businessman was going away, 
			 the businessman's wife asked the tailor to make a <span class="evidence">green hat</span> for the businessman.<br />
 
			  Whenever the wife put the green hat on her husband's head, this served as 
				a signal to the tailor that the businessman was leaving the village.  
				Over time, the other villagers figured out what was going on, and they would say to one 
				another&hellip;<em>Tade laopo gei ta dai lv maozi le</em> &ldquo;<span  class="evidence">His wife has put the green hat on him</span>&rdquo;<br />
				To this day, this phrase is what Chinese people use to talk about <em>wives having affairs</em>.  
				This phrase is the reason why Chinese men never wear green hats.  So, if you are going to China, 
			 whatever you do, don't bring a green hat to give as a gift to a male friend or business partner&hellip;
