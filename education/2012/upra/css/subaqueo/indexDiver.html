                  <b>Tips for Spearo's thinking of visiting New
                  Zealand</b>
                  <br />Print out a copy of this 
                  <a href="images/map.jpg">map</a>of the northern
                  north island, or find a bigger one from
                  somewhere. 
                  <br />
                  <br />Most people come to NZ to shoot kingfish,
                  and most bring their partners or families, so my
                  comments are for someone with that in mind.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <strong>Where are the Big Kingfish?</strong>
                  <br />Our most common pelagic fish is the
                  Kingfish (Yellowtail). They are found all over
                  the North Island, but the really big ones (100
                  lb) are found around the offshore islands, which
                  just happen to have the clearest water and are
                  nicest to dive. 100 lb fish have been taken at
                  Volkner Rocks (just off White Island, a 1 hour
                  boat trip from Whakatane, which is about 4 hours
                  southeast of Auckland) in the Bay of Plenty,
                  Great Barrier island (2 hours by ferry from
                  Auckland), Cape Karikari (4 hours drive north of
                  Auckland), the Mokohinau Islands (just north of
                  Great Barrier Island) and most of all the Three
                  Kings where a fisherman recently caught one over
                  130 lb. The The Three Kings islands are about 60
                  mils west of Cape Reinga, at the top of the North
                  Island. 
                  <br />
                  <br />Smaller kingfish (20 - 60 lb) can be found
                  around many rocky points and islands in a bit of
                  current, pretty much anywhere in the north. We
                  sometimes shoot them off shore dives at Ti Point
                  or Leigh Harbour, about 1 hours' drive north of
                  Auckland. 
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <b>Where do we spearfish the most?</b>
                  <br />The islands where we dive (refer my map)
                  include the Aldermans, the Mercury Islands, the
                  Hen &amp; Chicks, Little Barrier, the Bay of
                  Islands, and the Cavalli Islands. There are often
                  kingies seen and speared there. Your chance of
                  getting one on a single day is probably 20/80 or
                  80/20 depending how good you are or where you go.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <b>What else can I hunt?</b>
                  <br />Aside from deer (central north island and
                  sout hisland) and wild pigs in the forests
                  (everywhere), we also collect paua (abalone),
                  crayfish, and sand scallops. Other fish we
                  spearfish we spear for their excellent eating
                  include snapper (very hard to spear, grow up to
                  15 kg/33 lb), tarakihi, john dory, golden
                  snapper, trevally, butterfish, etc. Most serious
                  locfal spearo's mainly hunt big snapper because
                  of the challenge it offers.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <b>Tourist Destinations</b>
                  <br />If you are bringing family, you may wish to
                  do some touristy things. Many tourists go to
                  Rotorua (hot mud pools etc, which is OK if you
                  are into it, but not that exciting and there is
                  no diving there). The South Island is beautiful
                  (high mountains, hiking in summer,and skiing in
                  winter near Queenstown) but crap for diving.
                  Auckland is a nice city, Wellington is just plain
                  windy. In the south island, Christchurch and
                  Dunedin are just cold, Queenstown is nice for
                  skiing and hiking and sightseeing, bungee
                  jumping, white water rafting, jet boating, etc (a
                  bit like Banff in the Canadian Rockies, only with
                  a big lake).
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <b>Where not to go for the diving</b>
                  <br />The West Coast of the north island is
                  usually rough as guts and mostly has very dirty
                  water near the coast, but plenty of big kingfish
                  if you can find a place calm enough to dive with
                  some rocks, water clear enough to see them, and
                  if you are not afraid of the odd curious bronze
                  whaler shark. We have very few sharks here,
                  actually, just the odd inquisitive bronzie. We
                  normally dive the northern part of the east
                  coast.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <b>Arriving in Auckland, and getting out for a
                  dive</b>
                  <br />Your plane will most likely arrive in
                  Auckland. If the Bluefins are going out and the
                  weather is right, we may be able to take you for
                  a dive in the weekend. Or, we can try and get you
                  out on someone else's boat or a charter trip to
                  some good spots (even the scuba boats will let
                  spearo's come out, if that's the only way to get
                  you out). 
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <a href="http://www.wildblue.co.nz"
                  target="_blank">Wild Blue</a>, our local
                  spearfishing shop, is very good. They organise
                  club trips too, and either they or we (our club
                  is the bluefins) may have a trip that suits your
                  timing. So, I don't think we'll have any trouble
                  getting you out for a dive, but if the weather is
                  crap and you can't hang around, then you may need
                  to reschedule stuff or drive to somewhere that is
                  diveable at the time. Other charter options that
                  may accommodate one person or a group include

                  around</b>
                  <br />Other visitors have had great trips down to
                  Whakatane diving at White Island, or take a
                  charter from Waihau Bay or East Cape, Whakatane
                  of the Three Kings (book a trip as an individual
                  through 
                  <a href="http://www.wildblue.co.nz"
                  target="_blank">Wild Blue</a>), or to the Bay of
                  Islands, where you can hire a small boat from the
                  main wharf, or even a yacht for the family! We
                  get up there often as it's only 2 hours 45 mins
                  drive from Auckland we may be able to take you
                  out if we plan it right. 
                  <br />
                  <br />There is a 5.5m runabout (surveyed for 4
                  people) available to rent at Mangawhai Heads
                  (about 1.5 hours drive from Auckland) Bookings
                  available from the bait/fish shop at Mangawhai
                  Heads. Accommodation for 5-6 people is available
                  at Wood Street at Mangawai Heads. Cost $300 per
                  day + running costs, insurance bond payable.
                  Phone Andrew Leys 09 374 4901 027 4477 863 or
                  email LEYSA@anz.com This sounds like a well
                  appointed boat the aluminium hull is a Surtees, a
                  good looking and strong local design. From
                  Mangawhai, you can go to the Hen &amp; Chicks
                  easily. Watch for strong easterliy swells that
                  may make the bar at the harbour entrance too
                  rough, but the charter is refundable if the
                  weather is too rough.
                  <br />
                  <br />We often recommend the Bay of Islands for
                  tourists as they can do nice outdoors stuff -
                  boat trips, sandy beaches, diving, trip to Cape
                  Reinga sight seeing, whale and dolphin watching,
                  lovely beaches further north, small towns,
                  friendly people better weather, etc. 
                  <br />
                  <br />Some divers have chartrered one of the
                  launches from the Bay of Islands or Whangaroa and
                  gone to the Three Kings to spear big kingfish.
                  This costs more, but the chances of success are
                  high. Watch the weather, it is a wild place up at
                  the Kings! Charter boats are busy game fishing
                  year round from the Bay of Islands for broadbill
                  swordfish, and in summer time, some of the best
                  marlin fishing in the world is done from the Bay
                  of Islands, Tutukaka, or Whangaroa..
                  <br />
                  <br />A campervan is a popular idea for families,
                  as you can cruise to a deserted beach somewhere
                  like Matai Bay (Cape Karikari) and do what you
                  want at your own pace. Or, hire a car and the
                  motels and campsites are cheap.

                  <b>Marine Reserves - experience the best diving
                  in the world!</b>
                  <br />Anyone into u/w photography or just wanting
                  to see what life can be like if we giove teh
                  oceans a chance should definitely spend some time
                  at one of our amazing marine reserves. Near
                  Auckland, Goat Island marine reserve is a must
                  see! Vis usually 3 - 15 metres depending on wind
                  being on- or off-shore and time of year. It's
                  usually 8m or more, and is one of the clearer
                  shore dives. A great place to see huge snapper,
                  crayfish, and lots of other reef fish. Getting
                  there: drive just over one hour north of
                  Auckland, just past the coastal settlement of
                  Leigh. Gear can be hired at the shop just past
                  Leigh, or sometimes at the reserve area in
                  summer. There are no other costs. DO NOT feed the
                  fish (unnnecessary anyway - you WILL see big
                  snapper regardless) - you are not allowed to harm
                  or remove ANY marine life from the reserve.
                  <br />
                  <br />The Poor Knights consistently get ranked as
                  one of the top dive destination in the world.
                  Usually clear blue water (10 - 30 metres vis).
                  Getting there: drive to Tutukaka. The Poor
                  Knights is an entire island group situated off
                  the northland coast. Snapper numbers are 13 times
                  higher than the non-reserve areas - believe it!
                  Kingfish are common, as are many other species
                  that are fished down around the coast. Get there
                  on 
                  <a href="http://www.diving.co.nz"
                  target="_blank">Dive Tutukaka</a>. They look
                  after freedivers too!
