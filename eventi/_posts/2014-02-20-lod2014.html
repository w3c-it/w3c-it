<p>&#8220;The Semantic Web isn't just about putting data on the web. It is about making links, so that a person or machine can explore the web of data. With <strong>linked data</strong>, when you have some of it, you can find other, related, data.&#8221; (<a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html">Tim Berners Lee</a>)</p><p>&#8220;We are surrounded by data &#8211; data about the performance of our locals schools, the fuel efficiency of our cars, a multitude of products from different vendors, or the way our taxes are spent. By helping us make better decisions, this data is playing an increasingly central role in our lives and driving the emergence of a <strong>data economy</strong>&#8221; (<a href="http://linkeddatabook.com/editions/1.0/#htoc1">Tom Heath &amp; Chris Bizier</a>)</p><p>The W3C Office in Italy is organizing the Linked Open Data (LOD) event that will be held in Rome on 20th, 21st February 2014</p><p>The &#8220;<strong><em>LOD2014</em></strong>&#8221; event is centred around a keynote presentations from <strong>Phil Archer</strong>, a key W3C team member for the Semantic Web and LOD effort.
